1. I hardcoded genres in movie_genre.py. Perhaps there's a better way to do it using the API? I used this in MLB (multilabelclassifier) in init fn of classifier.py, so we 
know the names of the genres when it predicts the test data. 
^^^ Actually nvm. 

2. What is fit in the context of mlb and dictVectorizer? Still unsure.

3. change colors.p such that it returns a dict --- so i don't have to change it in classifier.py. 

4. We're using way too many labels--- we should check which ones we're actually using and only do them.

1. From looking at the genres list, here are genres not worth keeping:
   Music: every music movie is also a drama
   Sport: only one movie
   Western: no movies
   War: no movies
   Musical: no movies
   Mystery: only 4 movies and at least 2 of them aren't really mysteries
   Family: only 3 movies and no reason why these are family while others not
   Film-Noir: no movies
   History: only 2, always paired with documentary and biography
   Crime: only 6 but pretty varied
   Thriller: only 6, always paired with action or horror
   Biography: Nearly every biography film is also a drama (the ones that aren't
   are arguably not biography films at all)
   Fantasy: Only 5 films, but they are varied
   Sci-Fi: Some of the movies here shouldn't count. Like "The Purge: Anarchy"
   is not really sci-fi at all (a horror movie about a society which has
   a night every year where all laws are suspended and people kill each other)
   or Hot Tub Time Machine 2 (the sci-fi here is not really sci-fi).
   It's not a super discernible genre and it's never ever given unless with
   two other genres.
   Romance: Only 4 films, a few are arguably not Romance films
   (like "The Other Woman")
2. Genres to think about:
   Action: Half of the time it shows up, it is paired with adventure
   Adventure: Half of the time it shows up, it is paired with action
   Documentary: I strongly believe every film listed as a documentary is
   not a crossover with any other genre of film. For instance, one film
   "On Any Sunday The Next Chapter" is listed as "Action, Documentary, Adventure"
   because it's a documentary about motorcycle riders, but being a documentary
   it isn't even close to the other action/adventure movies. Maybe stripping
   any genres when "documentary" is given would be helpul.
