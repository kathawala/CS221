I should drink out of this
afternoon's heart

So I fall asleep

Before I go dark

Back in

Pouring rage

I fell throwing up

I can't shake it away

Luck is like a marble

On the stage

It waits

For our big break

To fall

The following Brooklyn-bound "L" train

will depart in approximately
seven minutes.

Why did you fly away?

I've been dying a little death
since that very day

I used to laugh

when you told me

Hello?

- Hello?
- Franny.

- Mom?
- Franny.

Mom?

Hello?

Your brother was in an accident.

He's in the hospital.

You need to come home.

The impact occurred in
what's called the Pterion,

an especially vulnerable part
of the skull.

You see this bright biconvex region here
that looks like a lens?

This is what we call a hematoma to the
brain tissue, a sort of blood clot...

Can you just tell me
if he's gonna be okay?

I have to tell you,
he might never come out of this.

We can't really say for sure.
In these situations,

we have no recourse
other than to be patient and wait.

You cut off all your hair.

Not all.

I loved it long.

I wanted a change.

Taxi driver's name is Rumnesh.

He has a wife and two kids.

They think he tried to stop
the car in time,

but Henry had his headphones on,

and I guess he didn't look
when he was crossing.

I haven't been paying attention.

He's been, just,
living somewhere in Brooklyn.

He comes home sometimes to do his laundry,
but it's all about music for him,

and I've been trying to finish
the book and just...

You couldn't have stopped him
from crossing the street.

I always told him to look both ways.

You just do your best, you know?
You just do your best.

Thankfully your father
isn't alive to see all this.

It's just a lot for us
to handle, you know?

You're gonna
have to sleep in Henry's room.

There's so many boxes in your room.

- It's okay. I'll just move the boxes.
- No, I gave your bed to Sylvia.

Who's Sylvia?

She delivers the mail.

- Why'd you give her my bed?
- Because...

you know, I asked her if she wanted a bed,
and she seemed so happy,

and you're never here, Franny.
I mean, you haven't lived here in years,

and you always complained
about that mattress anyway,

- so just don't get all bent out of shape.
- I'm not bent out of shape.

Hey, Franny, I...

I know you're busy, and I know
you think this is a waste of time.

I'm not sure if you've listened
to anything else I've sent,

but here's another song I just finished,

probably the first one
I'm really proud of.

I hope you listen to it.

I have walked so much farther

I thought

I should drink out
of this afternoon's heart

So I fall asleep

Before I go dark

Henry.

I don't really...

I don't...

I don't really know

what to do now.

Fuck!

It waits

For our big break

To fall

Okay. Enjoy.

James Forester!

James Forester!

Hey.

Hello, New York.

You got your little hearts and

Waitin' for the dawn

You've been brainstormin'

By my place

In the sun

And my bulb went black

And a thousand diamondbacks

Came slitherin'

And hummin'

We build a little bonfire

By the two cent bridge

You were dreaming of the crossing

I was staring

At the edge

And my jaw went slack

And a thousand razorbacks

Came chargin'

Screamin'

Thank you, Forester.

Take care.

Thank you.

Thank you.

- All right, man.
- Bye.

- James?
- Hey.

- I really liked the show.
- Thanks.

My brother was hit by a car this week.

I'm... I'm so sorry to hear that.

Henry Ellis. You're his favorite.

- Is he okay?
- He's at Memorial intensive care.

- He's in a coma.
- Jesus, I'm so sorry.

You don't remember him, do you?

He sent a letter to you
or to your record label.

The... yeah, the label
gets a lot of letters,

and then it takes 'em a while
to get to me, so unfortunately...

Okay. Okay.

Well, I brought you something
he was working on.

I thought... It's really good.

I guess I'm not the only one.

Thank you. Thanks so much.

- It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

- I'm Franny, Franny Ellis.
- I hope Henry gets better.

Thank you.

Hey, I made you eggs.

Thank you.

I just... I can't...
I can't eat right now.

Hey, how does this sound for a title?

Mythological foundations:
Tales of Monkokobaka and the Dekay tribes.

Sounds good.

It's so pointless.

How can I even do this right now?

Okay, write.

Fall

Hey.

All dead and gone

All dead and gone

My old man, my grandpap
First white man to the cumberland gap

My old man, my grandpap
First white man to the cumberland gap

Cumberland gap

Cumberland gap
All dead and gone

All dead and gone
All dead and gone

- Hey.
- I was...

Hi.

I was just in the area and thought,

maybe I'd just, you know, stop by.

Didn't know if you liked sugar.

Thank you.

Thanks.

I'm okay. Thank you.

Aren't you really busy?

Depends on how you define "busy."

I guess I always think
of people like you having...

Things lined up
every millisecond of the day...

Back-to-back meetings
with important people.

I listened to Henry's song.

It's great. I mean, I liked it a lot.

I know. It's really good, isn't it?

You know, he would really flip out
if he knew you were here.

He's kind of obsessed.

Not like in a freaky way or anything,
just, you know.

I could play him something if...
Not if... Not if you don't want me to.

- I don't have to.
- No, no.

That would be great.
I'm sure he would love that.

Dressed in white cotton

Staring at the phone

I was hiding in the attic

The day you left home

Mother, I thought that you

Turned back

That that big black Cadillac

Took you

Mother, I see you

But only in dreams

You put me in a basket

And you push me upstream

But I'm always

Driftin' back

Where that big black Cadillac

Took you

Oh, mom.

This is James Forester.

The singer?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Thank you so much for coming

and for the tea.

Please, this is the least I could do.

Oh, sorry.

I'm going to this place tonight... this club
Henry likes... If you want to come.

I've never been there before,
but the... there's a show at 11:00,

and I'm probably gonna go to this place
beforehand, this other place that he likes.

You're probably really busy
with a lot of other things.

I'm not... I'm not playing tonight,

and I don't have any meetings
or anything then either.

Oh, good. Yeah, I got it. Good. Okay.

- Cool.
- Great.

- Oh, where?
- What?

The place.

Berry and 11th...
North 11th in Williamsburg.

- 9:00?
- Okay.

Okay.

Father is sleepin'

Upright in his vest

I brush away the ashes

He's the only 19-year-old
I ever saw with a gramophone.

He was telling me that it broke
a couple of weeks ago.

You turn back

That that big black Cadillac

Is turnin' round

Where does Henry sleep?

It's right over there.

- Here?
- Yeah.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Do you have a gramophone?

No. Junk Market might
have one down by the B.Q.E.

Thank you.

What about keyboards?

Yeah, we just got in
a vintage '59 Rigaledo.

- Can I... Can I see it?
- Yeah, sure.

Check this sweet thing out here.

So...

What's your deal?

Well, I...

I... Yeah, I put out
an album five years ago,

bought me indie fame
and sort of fortune.

I'm a libra.

Go on.

Okay. I...

I live in a cabin in Maine.

It's where I normally am
when I'm trying to be creative.

I haven't really been able
to write much of anything

since the last album, though.

Last time, I mean with the album,

it was easy. I just got
in my car and drove.

Me and Tessa, my ex-girlfriend.
I mean, well, we...

Yeah, we broke up about a year ago.
We were together a long time.

She found someone else.

- Sorry.
- It's all right.

What about you?

I'm getting my PhD in anthropology.
Nomadic tribes in Morocco are my specialty.

Cool. It must be a lot
of work getting a PhD.

I get to ask a lot of questions,

and I listen to people.
It's a lot of reading.

I've been reading Henry's journal.

His... reading his most
private thoughts. I...

I've been going to places he went to.

I've started recording sounds
he might recognize.

- It's just really messed up.
- You're his sister. I get it.

We had a fight, like,
our first real adult fight, you know?

He...

He dropped out of college
to be a musician.

I said I thought that
he was making a huge mistake.

I said so many awful things.

We haven't talked in six months.

He sent me all these links
to videos he'd made,

songs he'd recorded, and...

I didn't open a single one.

- I'm sorry. I...
- Hey, it's...

It's all right. I can't even imagine.

- You're James Forester, right?
- Yeah.

- Will you sign my iPod?
- Sure.

Here you go.

- Thank you. I love your music.
- Thanks.

Call me aside and I will now be

And I will be fine with that

You don't leave me now
You might love me back

Distance is fine
I know you can't care

And nothing is big like that

Don't see you now, I don't see you back

One day I'll be fine with that

Don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

I don't speak Portuguese,
and so this isn't gonna be pretty,

but I am the last guy of the night,
so here you go.

How long are you here for?

Two more shows in New York,

a wedding.

Who's getting married?

I don't know them.
I'm the entertainment.

I never would have pegged you
for a wedding singer.


- That's not bad.
- I'm not proud of it.

Last show's in Philadelphia,
and then that's it.

I'm going back home.

I'm actually kind of
freaked out right now.

They're trying to get me to go
and record in Berlin after this,

but the truth is, I'm just stuck.

What happens if you don't write
any more songs?

I'm not really sure.

You know, the best thing
about playing...

You know when you have a feeling

and you don't want to fade away,
but you don't really know how to keep it?

Well, that feeling comes back when I play,
like I can keep it.

No... No talking,
no disappointing anyone

for three to five whole minutes.

You should try playing longer songs.

Yeah, I should.

Why don't you try to choose something

and write a song about it, like a nose?

- Nose?
- A nose.

I don't think nose songs are my thing.

You could write
the greatest song in the world

about a nose...

Or ears.
There's a lot of different types of ears.

There are endless possibilities.

I wish I could turn this

Into a s... into a song

Ears and noses

Rhymes with roses

- And...
- Neurosis

Halitosis

Ears and noses, halitosis
Ears and noses

I can get it from here.

- You all right?
- Yeah.

Guess I'll see you.

Yeah.

Thanks again.

I don't know.

I'm really sorry, Henry.

I didn't mean you were stupid.
I'm stupid.

I'm sorry.

You know I say things. Sometimes
I get too opinionated, too stubborn.

You have to be okay.

So I heard when you're not on the road,
you spend most of your time in the country.

What are you, like, a hermit?

No. Not... Not really.

You once said you have no interest
in modern technology,

that all you need is music
and the person you love.

Yeah. Yeah. Maybe... maybe I said that.

What's the strangest thing
that's happened to you on tour?

I was chased by a moose.

- What?
- In California.

I remember her red tank top
tucked into her Vanderbilt blue jeans

Her eyebrows painted on
like arches of Saint

Louis in the magazines

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

I love your apron

Heaven on your head

- Mom?
- Franny.

- What are you doing?
- I am making piaya.

Right. It's June 4th.

- Damn it!
- God!

Get the pillowcase out of the oven.

God.

So loud!

God, it's so loud.

Thank you.

Jesus.

You... You be in charge of...

You be in charge of the glasses
and the decorations, okay?

Thanks.

You got your little hearts and

Waitin' for the dawn

You've been brainstormin'

By my place

In the sun

And my bulb went black

And a thousand diamondbacks

Came slitherin'

And hummin'

We build a little bonfire

By the two cent bridge

There's a cat waving at you.

It's one of those mechanical
good luck ones.

I was staring

At the edge

Looks really good in here now.

Actually it looks
pretty horrible, but...

it's better than it was.

It's your half-birthday,
and we're celebrating it.

Do you remember when we were
in Zurich for your half-birthday?

You were, like, five.

All you wanted were M&M's and lemonade,

and we couldn't find any. It was just
expensive Swiss chocolate everywhere,

and then finally, we found some M&M's
after hours of searching,

and mom bought you, like, 50 packs,

bought out the store.

Happy half-birthday, Henry.

Sorry about all this.

Happy half, Henry.

Hey.

- Sorry if I'm interrupting.
- You... You are not.

Come on in. Join the party.

I think we even have an extra hat.

Here you go.

Looks nice.

It's Henry's half-birthday.

Keyboard looks good too.

Hey, have some persecco.

Don't tell the nurses.

- Thanks.
- Sure.

Cheers.

Thank you.

Turn left.

Please.

You didn't even speak Russian.
Why did you want Henry to learn it?

I wanted us to learn it together.
Secret language.

Yours and 150 million
other people's secret language.

I don't speak Russian.

Why do they always make you learn that?

It is obvious you don't speak Russian.
Why do you have to go around stating that?

Mom, I just... I wish you
could listen for two minutes.

I'm so sorry.
That is good coming from...

Never mind.
No, no, no, no. Come on, mom.

Tell me. What were you going to say?

I was going to say that that is good
coming from a girl who didn't even call

her own brother back
to say she was sorry.

You can't tell me that you thought that
dropping out of college was a good idea.

Franny, he did not want to go back.

- What was I supposed to do?
- You never would have let me do that.

You never would have wanted
to have done that ever.

And speaking of you, you basically
dropped off the grid for six months.

For six months, we didn't hear
anything from you and...

- Oh, is that okay?
- No, I called you. I did text.

Oh, yeah. The famous text, yeah.

Well, if you would empty your voicemail
every once in a while.

That's it. Yup, that's it.
You're right. You have all the answers.

You came out of my womb
havin' all the answers, man.

- God!
- Oh, my God.

James.

Would you like to come over for dinner?

I have a show tonight.

- Okay. Tomorrow night then.
- Mom.

You... You don't have to, really.

I would love to.

Temperature

Keeps rising like

A helium balloon

Sound of the helicopters

Echo in the bedroom

- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

- I'm... I'm glad you came.
- Yeah?

I just...

Decided to last minute, yeah.

Do you want...

Do you want a star fruit?

- No, thank you.
- Yeah, I'm not big on star fruit either.

Let me see that.

James, you're up.

Good luck out there.
They're wild tonight.

We slipped out under cover of champagne

You tried to kiss me by the dollar save

Instead I took your hand

As we rode around the aisle

Fillin' up our pockets with aspartame

And your little yellow dress

Made me go ballistic

Begged you not to change it

And you never did

I'm so glad

That you disappear when things got bad

And I cut off all my hair

You swore I would stay forever

Piston boots and jeans

Pegged at the ankle by the seams

You checked out

Before I started riding

Could you hear the sirens
from the backseat?

And your little yellow dress

God, you're so sadistic

Let me underneath it

Now you keep it hid

Oh, I'm so glad

That you disappeared when things got bad

And I cut off all my hair

I still keep my money

In the pillow on my bed

Yes, the black dog still following

You would find it funny

Maybe hysterical

But I still believe in miracles

And your little yellow dress

Thought you were a mystic

Thought you could predict it

But you never could

Your little yellow dress

Made me go ballistic

Never will forget it

And I never should

- Discman.
- Yeah, I'm a bit old-fashioned.

This is my favorite song in the world.

I'm ready.

I like it when you do it like that

Yeah, like that

This is your favorite song?

I like it when you do it like that

Okay, oh. Not that one.
That's a guilty pleasure.

It's an old mix. Hold on. Wait.

Okay, I think you're gonna love it.

My baby don't care for shows

My baby don't care for clothes

My baby just cares...

This is for you from Katie Johnstone.

"Hey, James. Give 'er a listen."
I think he's trying to speak to you as you.

- Give 'er. Give us a listen.
- Yeah, yeah.

"Dear James, I have been"...

- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's an epic.

"I would be extremely stoke...

"Ed to get a coffee, or in my case,

"a hot chocolate because
I don't like coffee very much."

You're kidding me.

"You would like it."

She sounds like she just drank
a hell of a lot of coffee.

Wow.

She sort of got the eyes right.

- What?
- Yeah, this is hilarious.

Oh, my good...
"Die, James, die... James."

And check out this side.

"I'm coming, James.

James, James, James, James."

That's my favorite one.
Look at the eyes.

- I just got kind of worried about you.
- Look at the eyes.

They're gonna hypnotize me.

Beautiful. You have to try it on.

- It's gonna be way too small.
- It's a medium.

- It's a children's medium.
- I don't... It's cotton. It'll stretch.

- Really?
- Yeah.

For you.

Sorry.

There.

I'm ready to go out now.

Well, I ask myself, what have you done
my sisters and brother?

I don't know
I don't know

Say you told your lie without no shame

Listen, y'all

It ain't easy

There'll be nowhere to run

Well, you shoulda gone and paid

Yeah

For what you done

- You know, this is really good.
- It's not mine, the zombies.

How does the melody line go?

Something like... Can't nobody

Love me

Do you want to see the view from the top
of the empire state building?

Definitely not, I'm afraid of heights

You don't want to go up high?

Don't want to touch the sky?

- 'Cause you're afraid...
- Afraid of heights

"Ulysses now left the haven

"and took the rough track up
though the wooded country

"and over the crest of the Mountain

till he reached the place
where Minerva had said."

I actually don't mind
the smell of smoke in my house

because it reminds me
of presanitized times, you know,

like Paris in the '70s.

- Were you there in the '70s?
- Who wasn't?

Well, I... Okay, a lot of people weren't,
you two for example,

but my God, I'm sorry you weren't.

It was so great.

I got...

So much there.

I got my master's,

lovers... I won't say how many.
Don't worry.

A husband.
I was an Arkansas girl in Paris.

How great is that?

And then of course,
I did date a famous rock star.

Who?

She hasn't even told me.
I'm not even sure it's true.

Of course it's true.
Why would I make that up?

This guy was amazing.

He taught me one of the hardest songs
even to learn on the guitar.

Blackbird by the Beatles.

Great song. Never learned it.

It is a great one, James.

Oh, my God.

I gave Henry one time for Christmas,

and he loved it so much,
this unbelievable green accordion,

and he slept with it.

It was a Teddy bear.
It was like his Teddy bear, you know?

My mom gave me my first guitar
when I was 13.

Yeah, did it have a picture
of a hulu dancer on it?

Nope, unfortunately...

- Here it is.
- Oh, hey, come on.

Thank you.

You are a very good girl.
I don't know how you are my daughter.

- Well, you raised me well.
- Yeah, so well.

Oh, my God. That was so bad.

Why, thank you.

Franny, what was the song
that you were so obsessed with.

Come on. By America? By America.

- Oh, I don't remember.
- Oh, you remember.

Oh, my God. Yes, you do. She remembers.

She sang it nonstop, all the time,

over and over and over and over.

She sang it in the school talent show
because it was the '92 election,

and she believed
that it had political subtext

about how much the country needed
to have Bill Clinton elected as president.

- I was eight.
- And here it is.

- Oh, no. No!
- No, come on.

- You did so good.
- No.

Come on. You were so good.

- No, I wasn't.
- So good.

Mom, come on.
This... this is embarrassing.

- I don't believe in embarrassment.
- I am kind of curious now.

Come on, Franny.
It'll just make me so happy.

We used to laugh

We used to cry

We used to bow our heads

Then wonder why

And now you're gone

I guess I'll carry on

And make the best
of what you've left to me

Left to me

Left to me

I need you

Like the flowers need the rain

You know I need you

Guess I'll start it all again

You know I need you

Like the winter needs the spring

You know I need you

I need you

And every day

I'd laugh

Beautiful.

Mom.

Just knowing you were thinkin' of me

- Mom.
- No. I have to go to bed.

Beautiful.

For every story told about me

About me

She'll be okay.

About me

I need you

Is that something new?

Nah, just...
No, something been thinkin' of.

Might be nothing.

When are you heading back home?

Day after tomorrow,
right after the show in Philly.

Come on.

Hey, James.

- Hey.
- Hey, thanks, man.

You were great,
really made Lisa's night.

- Thanks. Thank you.
- Thank you.

James. Thank you.

- I just want to get one picture.
- Sure.

Oh, yeah.

Good. Great.

All right, that's enough.
Probably get back in, you know?

- Thank you.
- I know. He's amazing. You're welcome.

I know. This is kind of short.

This... This is something
I've been working on...

Something new,

still in progress,
but I hope you like it.

All right. That wasn't it.

Henry! Henry.

Hey.

Hey.

Henry. Henry?

Henry, can you hear me?

No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

Come back. Come back.
Henry, come on. Come on, wake up.

I need somebody. My brother...
I need a nurse. I need...

He... He opened his eyes.
I saw it. He...

I'm going to go talk to the doctor,

and he'll talk to you.

Come on, Henry.
Henry, wake up. Wake up, please.

Henry.

It's me and Franny.

We know you can hear us, and we're here.

I broke up

With the man in the moon last night

Sorry.

Henry?

Hey. Hey.

Hey.

Henry.

Henry.

- Franny?
- Yes. Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm so sorry.

You need to keep your eyes open.

- Oh, excuse me.
- Yes, dear?

- Have you seen a guy with a guitar case?
- Sorry, I haven't.

I finally realized how hungry I am.

You want some?

Franny, no. No.

That is so, so bad for you.

I know. I am a hypocrite,
the worst kind.

Franny. He's gonna be fine.

Hey.

Hey.

Floatin' in the motel pool until

All the rooms were clean

Imagine angels in the sky

Were prettiest I'd ever seen

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

- Can I buy a ticket inside?
- Right inside there.

- I wrote something...
- Hi, one, please.

Show's sold out.

In fact, I've only played it
for two people.

I started it in New York
for someone I met there.

This one was a new experience for me.

It's not finished, and I...

I wasn't gonna play it tonight,
but for some reason...

Last show.

And... okay, I'll just...

I'm gonna get it over with now.

I remember that day

And the arms said noon

And my bed was in the dark

Underneath the blue balloon

Then a swarm of love

Surrounded me

And my head was standing on its end

With electricity

And as I looked out

On my old life

I was speeding through the forest

On a motorbike

I waved to you

But you couldn't see

I could hear a crowd of people
Calling after me

Wake up, little dreamer

It's time to rise

Open up your eyes

I've been holding out

For a lifeline

And I followed you

To the depths of my own mind

I've been wandering

Kind of scattershot

Bumpin' into other people's lives

Without a second thought

Now I do believe

In the mystical

That we have some vague connection

To the other world

And now all I've said

May not all be true

But this silver song I sing tonight

I swear it's just for you

Do you want to see the view
from the top of the empire state building?

Definitely not, I'm afraid of heights

You don't want to go up high?

Don't want to touch the sky?

- 'Cause you're afraid
- Afraid of heights

No, I don't wanna go

To the top of the empire state building

'Cause I'm afraid of heights

Oh, that's too bad.
It's real nice up there.

No, 'cause I'm afraid of heights

I remember her red tank top
tucked into her Vanderbilt blue jeans

Her eyebrows painted on
like arches of Saint

Louis in the magazines

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

Heaven on your heaven

Oh, heaven on your head

Sun

Floatin' in the motel pool

Till all the rooms were clean

Imagine angels in the sky

Were prettiest I'd ever seen

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

Heaven on your heaven

Oh, heaven on your head

Sun

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

I'll wait until

Iris instilled

- I'll wait until
- I'll wait until

Iris instilled

- I'll wait until
- I'll wait until

Iris instilled

Heaven on your heaven

Oh, heaven on your head

Sun

The day we met my life was changed

I always heard that love was strange
and painful

Painful

One night you slept upon your side

Tangled in white you looked just like
an angel

An angel

So why

Did you fly away?

I've been dying a little death

Since that very day

I used to laugh

When you told me

You must forget and forgive to be free

Down by water dressed in black

I swore revenge to get you back, hateful

Hateful

I made my camp upon the hill

Drank whiskey from the secret still
Blameful

Blameful

So why

Did you fly away?

I've been dying a little death

Since that very day

I used to laugh

When you told me

You must forget and forgive to be free

And I never could admit

The part I had in this

So this is what I get

My friend

Now I know why

You ran away

And I've been dying a little death

Since that very day

I used to laugh

When you told me

You must forget and forgive

You must forgive just to live

You must forget and forgive

To be free
