You'll beat my ass? (LAUGHS)
She's gonna beat my ass, everybody!

(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
BLAIRE: Hey. Hey, baby.
MITCH: (THROUGH MONITOR)
What's up? You okay?
Uh-huh.
You sound, like, a little down.
Oh. No, no, no, no. I'm great.
Okay.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(WHISPERING) I got something to show you.
Ooh.
I'm excited.
Hang on real quick. I'm gonna pee.
(MITCH URINATING)
(IN DEMONIC VOICE) Mitch.
(CHUCKLING) Hey. I'm here.
I got something to show you.
You doing your demon voice again?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
You like them?
Yeah. Oh, that's so hot.
-It's getting me there. And feet, too.
-Yeah.
I love just the top of toes.
BLAIRE: (IN NORMAL VOICE) What, you...
Wait. You don't like them, do you?
No, it's just, you know,
there's other things I wanna see more of.
Yeah, it was worth a shot.
I think I know what you want.
Yeah, let's keep moving up.
There we go. That's closer.
My bruised knees.
-No. No, I don't wanna live there.
-No? That's not it?
I don't wanna live there. I wanna live higher.
Come on. You're a real estate agent.
Sell this to me.
(BLAIRE CHUCKLES)
Well, you are now looking at
the outside of a human's right leg.
(COUGHS)
You know what?
You should just let me come over
and show you how it's done.
No, you can't.
What do you mean, I can't?
No. My dad would kill you.
That's easy. Fine.
That's worth it. I'd die for you.
You're worth it.
I want you to take that shirt off.
Make me.
Take that shirt off before I cut it off.
That's really violent.
Take the shirt off, or I'll cut it off.
(MITCH LAUGHING)
Hey, that worked.
That does it for you? All right.
Keep going. Keep going, you're...
Faster. Come on.
(BLAIRE HUMMING)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want those hands down there.
No, no, no. Back down.
(CHUCKLING)
And I want those panties off,
or you're gonna lose them.
You're adorable.
And really sexy when you're violent.
Yeah?
Um...
(EXHALES)
What?
What, Miss Blue Baller?
Hey, girls get them, too.
Don't... I don't wanna hear about your balls.
That's so gross.
(LAUGHS) No, you know what I mean. Like...
I don't know what you mean.
I just have this mental picture of balls, but no.
Well, I feel like you.
I don't want to experience that anymore.
Um, which is...
(MITCH SNICKERING)
Why...
Do you have a little speech planned?
I... (LAUGHING)
Stop!
-What?
-I wanna make prom night the night.
Yeah?
You're serious?
Mmm-hmm.
You wouldn't lie to me?
No.
You wouldn't lie to me? You're serious?
No, I'm not lying to you.
That's great. That is...
(WHOOPING)
That's finally the reaction I was looking for.
(SING-SONG) Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Your boobies! Your, your, your, your boobies!
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHS)
Let's keep this show going.
(STAMMERING) I wanna see what I'm getting.
Prom night.
I got something to look forward to.
Hey, we'll call him back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-It's just getting good.
-Get the knife.
Get the knife, baby.
Let's see the whole show.
ADAM: Oh, hey, guys.
JESS: Oh, shit!
KEN: What's going on?
ADAM: Oh!
KEN: Oh! Someone's in their chonies!
JESS: What did we walk in on?
ADAM: Uh-oh.
A little cybersex!
KEN: Someone's in their chonies!
JESS: Blaire, you're a dirty girl.
You're going to hell now.
BLAIRE: What?
KEN: What are you guys doing?
Going to hell with the rest of us.
Nothing. What's up?
-Hey, guys.
-KEN: Where are you coming from, man?
Hey, Mitch. Why do you have
such a big boner, bro?
(LAUGHING)
-What are you talking about?
-JESS: I totally missed it.
-Shut up.
-KEN: Hey, Blaire.
-Hey, Ken.
-Not funny.
-How are you?
-Blaire, your blouse, babe.
What?
(CHUCKLING) What are you calling
my girlfriend "babe" for?
Hey, Mitch, who's your buddy?
-What?
-Who's your buddy?
Uh...
That's not with us.
KEN: What kind of sex were you guys having?
I thought you guys brought that in.
BLAIRE: Ken, we were not having sex.
-No, wasn't us.
-JESS: Were you having a three-way?
-No. What? Who is that?
-ADAM: Um...
I just tried to hang up on him.
MITCH: I don't know. It wasn't with us.
JESS: Cyber three-way!
-Ken?
-KEN: Yeah? Uh...
I tried to hang up on this thing.
It wouldn't let me.
JESS: You take turns?
MITCH: (STAMMERING)
Honestly, he is not in with us.
That came with you guys.
-It's not working.
-MITCH: All right.
KEN: All right.
-BLAIRE: What do you mean?
-Let's just call each other back.
-Yeah?
-MITCH: Okay.
-Bye.
-Bye.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(DIALING)
(LINE RINGING)
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)
KEN: Hi!
JESS: Hi!
ADAM: Why is this fucker still here?
What, Mitch's boner?
(LAUGHING)
What is this person's problem?
KEN: Guys, guys, it's definitely a hacker.
He's spying to get info
on farts and boners, okay?
MITCH: Is that what today's agenda is?
KEN: Well, we haven't hit the farts yet,
but thanks to the Ken's famous salsa,
the gas will be rolling tonight, baby.
BLAIRE: Guys, hey.
-All right, stop.
-JESS: You're so gross.
Can we get rid of this person?
Um...
How about I call Blaire back,
and then we'll go from there.
JESS: Bye.
KEN: Bye.
What's up?
It's still there.
So, were you guys really cybering?
No.
Is that, like, a thing you do?
-It's...
-Huh?
ADAM: It's really cute.
BLAIRE: It's still here.
ADAM: You guys are so cute.
JESS: Hey.
ADAM: Hey, guys.
JESS: Heyo!
It's still here.
Whatever, fuck it.
KEN: It's just probably a glitch.
How do we know that?
Yeah, I can't call the number
or anything like that. So it's probably...
ADAM: Oh, shit!
Three stars, motherfuckers! Suck on that!
KEN: Um... Yo,
so I talked to Kyle about Friday.
And I got the weed, but he's out of Molly. So...
(CONVERSATION FADES)
BLAIRE: What?
JESS: Blaire, come back!
Blaire! Where'd you go?
ADAM: Stop looking at porn!
MITCH: (LAUGHING) Shut up,
for, like, a second.
JESS: Are you talking to boys?
Hey, I'm writing an email. Stop.
KEN: ...from the horse's mouth.
(JESS LAUGHING)
BLAIRE: Guys, did you talk to Val tonight?
JESS: Oh, dude,
when we were at Adam's party,
she was telling people
I had a drinking problem.
ADAM: You do.
-I'm gonna add her.
-Can I just be honest? I don't like Val.
(JESS LAUGHING)
-Nobody likes Val.
-(DIALING)
-Can I just be honest? I don't like her.
-(LINE RINGING)
The only person that likes Val
-is Val.
-Is Val. Yeah.
You just get me, Jess.
ADAM: Hi, Val.
Hey, Val.
KEN: Hey, Val.
Val. Turn up the sound, you dumb bitch.
Val!
Can you hear me now, Ken?
-KEN: Yeah, there you are, you floozy.
-(JESS CHUCKLES)
Hi, yeah.
You know, when you talk and it's muted,
I can still hear you on your end.
So I don't appreciate "dumb bitch."
Okay. Did you guys buy your tickets,
like, two weeks ago like I asked you?
KEN: No, you said you were gonna get 'em.
VAL: No, you didn't.
No, I told you to buy them.
So now I'm hearing that you guys
are gonna be seated in the balcony,
and three of us
are gonna have to sit in the orchestra.
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-So, maybe you should
have bought your tickets...
BLAIRE: Why?
VAL: ...sooner like I told you.
-KEN: All right. What? I don't care.
-That's too bad.
I wish you bought your ticket earlier.
Um, which seats are better,
balcony or orchestra?
-Balcony.
-Balcony.
-KEN: I'll take orchestra.
-Okay, you're in balcony.
I can take one more in balcony.
I'll take it in the orchestra. (LAUGHS)
VAL: I'm sure you will.
BLAIRE: Jess. (LAUGHING)
-Oh, my God!
-You're, like, the only one that got that.
BLAIRE: Val.
VAL: What?
JESS: Wait. What?
BLAIRE: Looking good.
VAL: Thank you.
-BLAIRE: (CHUCKLING) No.
-I got a haircut, like, two days ago.
No. I mean, you look good right now,
too, but check your Facebook.
VAL: What?
BLAIRE: These are intense. Hold on.
-Did you give Jess permission?
-Jess! What the shit?
(LAUGHING) Dude!
VAL: Why would you post that?
This is the first time I'm seeing these.
These are incredible.
VAL: Oh, my God. It just
came from your account.
-I've never seen these before.
-Jess!
These are amazing.
Val, I didn't know you were so much fun.
Oh, my God! A bong?
Okay, seriously,
I'm friends with my mom on here.
-All right.
-VAL: Come on!
KEN: Should I look at these?
-Is this worth a look?
-VAL: What the hell! Delete these!
BLAIRE: Jess, take these off.
They're not good.
Dude, I didn't...
Delete them, Jess.
I didn't do this, okay?
I don't know why
you're getting so pissed at me.
Oh, my God.
You trashy little bitch. Delete them.
Wait. Wait, did you just call me trashy?
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, Jess.
So, you're asking me for a fucking favor,
to take down these photos
that I didn't post in the fucking first place...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm asking for a favor? I'm asking for...
-You posted them.
-Yeah, I didn't fucking do it, okay?
So you can be nice to me
-and I can help you...
-MITCH: You guys, shut up.
-BLAIRE: Girls.
-...or you can suck my fucking dick...
VAL: You were the only one
who was at that fucking party.
JESS: ...and piss off.
KEN: Whoa!
Close your trashy little mouth for,
like, one second and listen to me.
-BLAIRE: Girls.
-Dude, I will beat your ass
any goddamn day
if you come over here, bitch.
VAL: Oh, I'm so sure.
-I'm so sure.
-BLAIRE: Listen, we are not ghetto.
KEN: No. Okay, how about this? Mitch...
Blaire, really?
Do you want me
to fucking delete them or not?
Yes! Delete them now.
KEN: Look, I'll come pick you girls up
and we can go fight
outside of a Wendy's or something...
-Ken, not helping.
-BLAIRE: Ken. Stop, you're not helping.
We can go to a Taco Bell parking lot
and you guys can slap-fight it out.
JESS: I'm deleting them right now.
-I'll pick both of you up.
-Thank you, Jess.
BLAIRE: You wish.
(LAUGHING)
KEN: I am so wet right now.
VAL: They're still here, Jess.
JESS: It's, like, not working.
Why are you so quick to assume
that I posted these when I'm telling you...
VAL: Who else would have?
JESS: I've never fucking seen
these photos before, okay?
ADAM: Oh, my God! Shut up.
I try to hit delete, and it disappears.
I reload the page, it's still there.
I hit delete. I... I'm trying.
KEN: I have a headache.
I'm fucking trying to help you. Okay, Val?
You have a headache, Ken?
You have a headache?
Okay, it looks like it's working.
Thank you.
Okay.
Unbelievable that you would
think that would be fine.
Okay, they're gone.
KEN: No, they're not.
BLAIRE: No. Adam...
You owe me a thank you.
-VAL: Adam! What the shit!
-(KEN LAUGHING)
ADAM: What?
You posted some now, too?
Did you just copy and paste them?
-No. I didn't fucking post anything.
-JESS: Holy shit!
BLAIRE: You guys need to stop.
-I'm a bitch, Jess?
-ADAM: Chill out, Val.
Don't... Oh, you're doing your nails right now.
Oh, you're so innocent.
-I'm a bitch? Really?
-ADAM: Anger issues much?
Dude, I'm not even fucking typing.
I don't know what to say.
-What is happening right now?
-What the fuck?
Okay, I've dated, like, two guys.
-I didn't type that.
-Fuck you, okay?
I didn't type that.
Bullshit.
KEN: Hey, just... Somebody let me know
when it's fucking over.
I love that you think I'm a fucking slut,
and your ass is drunk...
-I didn't type that!
-BLAIRE: Girls, stop.
-Please.
-Okay, yeah, Blaire.
Just take Jess' side. Of course.
I love you girls so much. Let's be...
Oh, Blaire, you're just gonna take Jess' side?
-I deserve that?
-No, I'm not on Jess' side.
-You just typed that.
-I don't think she should have put these...
What?
No, I didn't type anything!
Oh, if you didn't type it, then who did?
(DOG BARKING)
VAL: Well, who the fuck is Billie?
JESS: I told you
I didn't post those photos, Val.
VAL: Guys, who is this?
-JESS: I don't know.
-He was here the whole time?
BLAIRE: Ken, you said it was just a glitch.
VAL: Well, the glitch just typed!
(DOG BARKING)
Brucer.
KEN: Dude, I bet
this guy's been here the whole time.
JESS: I do not know a Billie,
but he apparently hates Val.
This is Laura's account.
KEN: Are you sure?
(STAMMERING) I'm positive.
VAL: Not Laura Barns?
Yes, I'm still friends with her on here.
I never, like, deleted it.
JESS: Seriously?
BLAIRE: Who is doing this?
KEN: Uh...
Maybe it's Laura.
BLAIRE: Ken.
ADAM: Who hacks a dead girl?
JESS: Maybe it's her brother or something.
VAL: Why would he do that, Jess?
JESS: He was a weirdo.
VAL: Not that weird!
KEN: It's probably just,
like, a troll or something.
BLAIRE: What is a troll?
KEN: An Internet troll?
VAL: How do you not know what a troll is?
MITCH: Like, someone that
just harasses people online.
KEN: They just wanna
get reactions out of people.
VAL: Can we hang up on him?
KEN: No, I can't. I can't hang up on him.
VAL: If we can't hang up...
Fine, I'll take care of him.
Hi, Billie, listen, sweetheart.
You're a fucking asshole,
and if you don't take these down right now,
I'll come over there
and knock the trash out of your ears!
Who the fuck is this guy?
MITCH: Okay.
All right, all right, let's stop fucking around.
Everyone, hands up, right now.
Who's doing this?
ADAM: Not me.
MITCH: Adam, here we go.
JESS: I told you it wasn't me,
that's all I can say.
(DOG BARKING)
MITCH: All right, let's hang up on him.
KEN: There's, like, no... There's no button.
VAL: What do you mean?
BLAIRE: There is no button.
MITCH: What do you mean?
BLAIRE: There's no button to hang up on him.
VAL: Guys, he's, like, sending me something.
(DOG CONTINUES BARKING)
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?
(DISTORTED) This is fucked up,
do you hear me?
-Brucer, shut up!
-BLAIRE: Val, what is it?
KEN: Calm down, Val.
No, I can't calm down, this is messed up!
JESS: Aw, Val, I told you
not to Snapchat your boobs.
VAL: Oh, really?
Really? That's a threat. Yeah, you know what?
Yes, asshole, good news, I'm calling the cops.
Congratulations, dipshit.
(JESS CHUCKLES)
I'm calling.
-Val, you don't need to call the cops, all right?
-(LINE RINGING)
-Just calm down.
-VAL: Yes, I do. I do need to call the cops.
Okay? It's a threat.
Hi. Hi. Um...
Um, listen, my name
is Valerie Rommel, I'm online
and there's some asshole
making direct threats against me.
(DOG BARKING)
Brucer!
KEN: Yep.
VAL: Yeah. Hold...
Ken, I swear to God,
if I find out this is you, I will burn you alive.
-You understand me?
-KEN: Are you fucking kidding me?
Thanks for stopping by, Val.
Real nice lady, real nice chick.
She said she was gonna burn me alive, dude.
MITCH: This isn't you, Jess?
BLAIRE: Jess, it's not you?
No way. Not worth my time.
ADAM: She can't do
a PowerPoint presentation. How...
-It's more...
-BLAIRE: Can't really hear you, Adam.
More than likely,
it's some girl that she's pissed off,
and she's getting fucking scared,
and she fucking deserves it.
I'm sorry.
She takes a shit on everyone at school.
MITCH: Should we take screen grabs
of the stuff that he was saying?
It's "Billie" with an I-E. It's definitely a girl.
It's kind of threatening, right?
BLAIRE: He's been listening this whole time.
KEN: It's not letting me take a screen grab.
MITCH: Yeah, me neither.
ADAM: Let's just get out of here.
BLAIRE: Let's just hang up.
-KEN: Let's just get out of here.
-Let's just hang up.
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Hey!
Come over, Adam, and we'll go see, uh...
-ADAM: Kyle?
-We'll go across the tracks.
ADAM: All right, I'm down.
-Wait.
-ADAM: What?
BLAIRE: I just got an email from him.
MITCH: What is it?
BLAIRE: This is Laura's email.
ADAM: What'd they say?
BLAIRE: It's a link.
KEN: It's just a stupid troll, dude.
Obvious troll is obvious.
Just send it to Ken
so he can find out who it is.
Just forward it to me.
Yeah, let Ken, like,
try to find the IP address or something.
Okay, either I'm going crazy,
or there's no forwarding button.
MITCH: It's at the bottom,
if you click on, like, "Reply All."
BLAIRE: No, I know where it is, baby, but...
-MITCH: You in Gmail?
-Yeah.
Oh, my God, Blaire,
do you know how to use a fucking computer?
-Fucking open it!
-BLAIRE: I do.
Share me your screen.
ADAM: Jesus.
Just forward the shit on to Ken
so we don't have to deal with this again.
-My God.
-Adam.
See, look.
It literally doesn't exist.
There's no "Forward" button.
Do you see it?
KEN: No.
JESS: Dude, weird computer shit
happens to me all the time.
Click the fucking link, dude!
KEN: Yikes.
BLAIRE: Oh, Val.
Val, you're fucking sick!
KEN: In Val's defense, her comment
wasn't completely unwarranted, okay?
Nobody wants to talk about it,
but I'll give you the Ken-pinion.
Laura fucking sucked.
She was a big bully, okay,
and she deserved
all the shit she got from that video.
Ken, dude. Come on. (LAUGHS)
-BLAIRE: Ken.
-What?
KEN: Sorry. I'm sorry, that was in poor taste.
(TONE PINGING)
ADAM: "They should lock you up."
"You monster"?
ADAM: What the...
Okay, you're a fucking creeper.
What do you want?
BLAIRE: Val, what'd the cops say?
ADAM: What is it?
KEN: I think it's frozen.
(DOG BARKING)
JESS: Hey, Val, you stupid bitch,
say something.
ADAM: Did you guys hear her call?
(DOG CONTINUES BARKING)
BLAIRE: I'm calling her.
ADAM: Guys, look at her mirror.
KEN: Do you guys see the mirror?
JESS: The mirror's fucked up.
BLAIRE: Yeah.
MITCH: What's going on over there?
(LINE RINGING)
ADAM: Val!
KEN: Val?
JESS: Dude, maybe she's doing this shit.
-Like, for attention.
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
-MITCH: Blaire, is it going through?
-You think of that?
BLAIRE: Yeah, I...
Look, look at it! It's right there.
She's not...
-MITCH: Holy shit.
-(CONTINUES VIBRATING)
Wait...
(LINE RINGING)
(CONTINUES VIBRATING)
(VAL SCREAMS)
KEN: What was that?
MITCH: Holy shit.
ADAM: Shit.
BLAIRE: Val?
(DOG BARKING)
What?
Val!
MITCH: What the hell?
BLAIRE: What just happened?
JESS: What's going on?
BLAIRE: Did she close the computer?
Did it drop?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
MAN: Anyone home?
JESS: Hello?
KEN: Hello?
BLAIRE: Hello?
KEN: Hello?
MITCH: Hey.
MAN: Fresno County Sheriff's Office.
Somebody called 911?
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
BLAIRE: Hello?
MITCH: Can they hear us?
Hello, hey! Down at the computer!
-Hello?
-BLAIRE: Hello?
MITCH: Hey!
MAN: Dispatch, we got a...
ADAM: Hello?
JESS: Hello, can you hear us?
BLAIRE: Wait, what'd they say?
KEN: 10-35?
MITCH: I heard 10-25.
BLAIRE: Which one?
KEN: 10-30.
MITCH: 10-25.
-What is that?
-BLAIRE: 10-35...
-No, it's a time check, so...
-MITCH: That's insane.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
BLAIRE: 5250?
MITCH: 5250? I didn't hear 5250.
BLAIRE: No, it's a mental... (GASPS)
MITCH: No shit.
BLAIRE: Val used to have seizures!
-MAN: Yeah, we'll start around the...
-Guys, she...
KEN: Are you sure? I don't remember.
Yeah, she told me, like, a long time ago.
She had this sickness that causes seizures.
Maybe she just had a frickin' seizure.
ADAM: Have you ever seen
her have a seizure, ever?
MAN: Jesus. This is a 10-55.
No, dude, they said 10-55.
BLAIRE: 10-55?
MITCH: 10-55?
BLAIRE: 10-55...
Did they really just say 10-55?
(JESS SCREAMS)
-Val?
-JESS: Oh, my God.
MITCH: Hey! Hey!
ADAM: Hey!
BLAIRE: Hello? Hello?
MITCH: Shit.
ADAM: Shit.
MITCH: Okay. All right, I'm calling.
Does anyone know her parents' number?
KEN: I'll try to get her back, okay?
KEN: Nobody accept.
No one accept it.
What...
BLAIRE: Who are you?
BLAIRE: What did he send you guys?
What?
KEN: I can't fucking shut it off.
BLAIRE: We gotta get him out.
MITCH: Who cares?
We have to go over and help Val.
Okay? We can do this shit after.
BLAIRE: Wait, wait, hold on.
The cops are with Val.
MITCH: Yeah, we're doing this shit after.
KEN: What's the point?
BLAIRE: Hold on.
KEN: What are you guys
gonna do that the cops can't do?
MITCH: Fuck this! All right.
We're not doing this here.
Everyone, just fucking stop.
Pick up your phone, mute your computers.
JESS: I don't know where my phone is, guys.
Seriously, please don't do this.
Hold on, Jess...
(INAUDIBLE)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Fuck, guys.
Guys?
ADAM: ...Val's in five minutes.
MITCH: Whatever he's doing,
it can wait, okay?
JESS: Guys, I can hear you.
He can hear you. He can turn your mics on.
KEN: Guys, can you just
fucking trust me, okay?
Install this program
-and I'll find out who it is.
-MITCH: You serious?
ADAM: Who cares, dude?
Val's in fucking trouble. You just saw her.
MITCH: Okay, everyone relax.
BLAIRE: Ken can get him out, okay?
We need to stop this guy.
JESS: Please, Billie, just let us leave, okay?
KEN: You guys wanna
know who this is or not?
Yeah, we're ready to play, Billie.
-Jess, we're gonna play a game.
-What's going on, guys?
-I don't know what's happening!
-We're gonna play a game, okay?
You wanna play the game.
You wanna play the game.
Jess, you wanna play the game.
JESS: Okay.
MITCH: Okay, is it fixed?
JESS: What is it?
It's just a game. We're just all
gonna download it and play it, right?
I'm not doing anything, man.
I just wanted to play a game.
You like games. You seem to like games.
Dude, I thought we were gonna play.
All right.
I have a fucking great game for you, man.

MITCH: Okay. I just launched it.
I got something for you, Billie.
KEN: Fucking shit.
Okay, okay, okay. Is it searching, guys?
-Did everybody download it?
-BLAIRE: Mine's got something.
Mine's got something.
Okay, good. Wait till
everybody got something.
Is it flagging? Has everybody got some flags?
It should be more than one, too.
It should be multiple.
-JESS: Yeah.
-Okay, cool.
-BLAIRE: Yes.
-Okay, hit "Trash."
Trash all of those
and then empty your recycling bins, okay?
Yeah, empty your recycling bin
after you trash it.
Do not save them.
Everything. Everything that's flagged.
MITCH: It's not gonna delete these.
Just fucking listen to me. Trust me, dude.
MITCH: Shit. Shit.
JESS: Okay.
(STAMMERING) Is it deleted?
What's going on? Keep me updated, guys.
Okay. Okay, Adam's is done. Mitch?
Mine's the same.

MITCH: She's right. Adam,
you are overreacting.
KEN: It's gonna be fine. We just need...
BLAIRE: Just stop.
We're just waiting on Blaire's bin, guys.
Everything is gonna be cool, I promise.
-Blaire...
-There's a pinwheel, I don't...
Why is he counting down?
MITCH: Don't listen to him.
Don't worry about it. Just get it done.
KEN: Okay. It's cool, Blaire.
BLAIRE: All right, it's done!
Everything's... It's done.
-KEN: It's done? It's done? It's gone?

JESS: Dude, what the hell was that?
(KEN LAUGHING)
-MITCH: Did you load that thing?
-Yeah, man.
You were flinging it around!
It's going to go off.
KEN: Oh, my fucking God.
MITCH: I can't believe it.
Were you gonna shoot...
What were you gonna do,
shoot through the computer?
-Guys! Guys, I saved your life.
-We just...
Val used to get seizures.
I mean, that's the only thing
-I can think of.
-MITCH: We should call the cops.
MITCH: Okay.
I had a conversation on my computer...
(LINE RINGING)
FEMALE OPERATOR: (OVER PHONE)
ADAM: Yeah, hi, there's someone
threatening me and my friends online,
and they also threatened
our friend, Valerie Rommel.
You sent some officers
over there earlier to her house,
but they didn't see what we saw,
and there's a lot more to the story. So...
What is your friend's address?
-What?
-Her address.
Uh, guys? Guys, what's her address?
JESS: Uh, hold on,
I have it in my desk. Hold on.
ADAM: One sec.
JESS: 10705 East Bauer.
ADAM: Yeah, it's 10705 East Bauer.
And he keeps threatening us,
and he won't leave us alone, and...
Where are you right now, sir?
Um, I'm at home. Online, with my friends.
Are you safe?
Yeah.
All of you?
Yeah, we're good.
Even Ken?
What?
Don't hang up.

JESS: But what just happened?

BLAIRE: Who did you call?
Fuck! It's this fucking asshole!
KEN: Hey, genius, we can see you!
Hey! Hey, buddy!
Uh...
You know what?
JESS: What is that? It's behind, like, a lattice?
Like, a crate or something? Like...
KEN: It's not letting me hang up.
JESS: Wait, Ken! Ken!
KEN: What?
JESS: Wait, come back.

BLAIRE: Adam! Adam, stop!
MITCH: What? What?
Like the drinking game?
BLAIRE: What? Wait, how do you play?
How do you play?
MITCH: I'm not playing your fucking games.
Why don't you fucking explain it.
It's your fucking game, man!
Somebody just tell me how to play!
Guys... Jess, how do you...
Dude, you... Okay, you put up five fingers,
and then if you've done something,
you have to put your finger down.
That's how it works.
This is the dumbest fucking thing.
BLAIRE: Wait. Why are you... Why?
JESS: (CRYING) I'm gonna lose.
MITCH: Are we doing this?
JESS: I don't wanna play.
BLAIRE: Put your hands up.
Put your hands up. Put your hands up!
MITCH: Just fucking do it. Just fucking do it.
Fine, all right, five fingers up, fine.
BLAIRE: Who did that?
ADAM: Wasn't fucking me.
-JESS: Okay, fuck, it was me, okay?
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)
You said it was Val.
Okay, I lied, all right?
You...
It's not like
there's not some kind of truth in there!
Jess, what are you doing?
-Dude, it's not my fault!
-Why are you doing that to me?
You're the one who's like,
"I'm not hungry, I already ate."
-All that shit.
-MITCH: Do not do this right now.
ADAM: It wasn't fucking me.
It was one of you guys?
MITCH: Jess, stop it!
Don't attack people right now.
You know how much
fucking trouble I got in for that shit?
-I'm sorry, it was me, okay?
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)
We were drunk, and it happened,
and I didn't know how to tell you.
-Fuck you!
-I'm sorry, Jess.
Fuck you!
ADAM: Great friend, Blaire.
I have apologized.
She's not apologized
for starting this rumor thing about me.
That is not true, by the way.
MITCH: Hey! We're keeping together on this.
Stop it.
-That was me. Easy.
-(BUZZER SOUNDS)
It was last year. She kissed me.
I threw her off. Nothing happened.
It's fine.
ADAM: What? No, no, please tell me
he's lying, Jess, you fucking bitch!
-Fuck you. It wasn't me, okay?
-Shut up. Shut up!
-ADAM: Blaire?
-It was me, man. Hey, it was me.
-It was you?
-I'm sorry. Yeah.
-What? Why?
-What do you mean, "What? Why?"
Does it really fucking matter?
Yeah, it does to me, Mitch!
-They put me in fucking handcuffs, man!
-BLAIRE: Guys, stop it!
I almost had a record!
My fucking dad almost disowned me for that!
Dude, it was gonna be both of us or one of us,
and I would do the same shit for you.
-So let me take the rap, huh?
-BLAIRE: Hey, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter! Exactly, it doesn't matter!
Yeah?
-Oh, my fucking hero, Mitch.
-BLAIRE: Hey! Knock it off!
My hero!
Oh, fuck. You guys are fucked up, man!
Yeah, like you don't have
enough fucking money, okay?
-Oh, keep it, bitch!
-MITCH: Fucking asshole.
Oh, yeah, let's listen to Blaire again,
'cause that keeps working out so fucking well.
What?
Guys, are you serious?
MITCH: None of us did that.
We wouldn't do that.
ADAM: Blaire?
What?
Blaire, did you do that?
No!
ADAM: How do we know?
MITCH: Hey! It's not her. It's not her.
-I... We wouldn't do that.
-Put down a finger and we'll see.
She already said it. Stop pushing her!
Yeah, I heard her say that!
She always tells the truth, Mitch?
Yeah! Yeah.
Oh, she does?
She always tells the truth, right?
'Cause you always tell the truth, right, Blaire?
You always tell the truth.
ADAM: Fine, it was me.

You're a fucking piece of shit. You know that?
Oh, fuck you! You're a piece of shit!
-JESS: I'm just nothing to you, Adam.
-You piece of shit.

He said if I traded you
that the three of us could live.
-I was trying to save your life, Mitch.

-Just play the stupid game.
Hey, Billie, why don't you lay off?
I got this one.
JESS: What the fuck are you doing?
Easy one.
Never have I ever had sex.
Hey, Billie, can we get a timer, please?
MITCH: What are you doing right now?
Oop! There goes my finger.
Hey, Jess,
you only need to put down one, not 50.
JESS: Fuck you, Adam.
Oh, okay. Whoa!
Hey, that's weird. The timer's still going.
-Hey, Billie, why's the timer still going, huh?
-BLAIRE: What are you doing?
-Tick-tock...
-What are you doing, Adam?
-The round ain't over.

Someone hasn't answered. Hello?

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mitch.
MITCH: What do you mean?

-What are you doing? Is he serious?
-Mitchie, I'm so sorry.
-Don't...
-JESS: What?
Are you serious? He's telling the truth?
God damn it, Adam!
-What do you mean? What do you mean?
-It was an accident.
-It was an accident!
-MITCH: It was an accident?
I didn't mean to do that, Adam.
Oh, my God!
-I was drunk, okay?
-Oh, my God.
What were you doing?
It just... I'm sorry, it just...
-How? How? I don't get it. How?
-I hate you, Adam!
Fuck you, Blaire.
Stop talking, Adam! Stop it!
But, hey, it doesn't matter, remember, Mitch?
It doesn't fucking matter, right?
It does matter. It does matter, because...
We might all fucking die,
but we're better than you, you piece of shit!
