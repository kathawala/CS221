WOMAN: She's here!

- She's not on my list.

Yes, but she belongs

Right, but not anymore. INS rules are that
females have to be placed with families.

A family in Boston wants to take her.

But this is her family.
You cannot take her from us.

Those are the rules.

I want to speak to another official.

All right.

I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen.

Please, there must be something you can do.

Guys, we have to go.

I will find a way for us to be together again.

- Okay.

We'll be together again.

All of you, promise to go to school
and work very hard.

Be strong, my brother.

PAUL:

Great.

Okay, let's go.

Where is your village?

My village?

Uh, my village is...

...Elmwood Street close to the university,
lguess.

May I ask you, let me say,
where is your darling?

- My darling?
- Your husband.

Oh, no, no. I'm not married.

If you do not have a husband,
then it is your children who provide for you?

No. I don't have any children.
I'm not married.

I provide for myself.

Your survival skills are very impressive.

- Thanks.

CARRIE: I gotta go.

- He all right?
- He has a weak stomach.

Excuse me. What is that?

That's McDonald's.

Thank heavens. So sorry about the mix-up.

Well, I'm Pamela Lowi, your volunteer with Faith

I'm gonna take it from here,
but thank you so, so much.

- No problem. I'll see you later.
PAMELA: All right.

- Excuse me?
CARRIE: Yeah.

You make our hearts throb
for your many kind assists today.

- Would you be so kind to tell us your name?
- Oh, sorry. Didn't I?

My name's Carrie Davis.

I'll call you tomorrow morning
and we'll start the job hunt.

May you find a husband
to fill your empty house.

I'll work on that.

We have a lot to cover.
This is your fridge.

You got your cabinets up here,
your stove top.

And I made you this.

Okey-doke. Follow me.

This is your bedroom.

Cozy, huh? These bunk beds
were just donated to my church...

...so I snagged them for you.
They should do the trick.

See this?

If you flip it up, the light comes on.

Isn't that great?
There's one of these in every room.

Pamela, we have a sister,
and she has been separated from us.

Yes, right, your sister.

I'm so sorry. No family here wanted her.

Switching the paperwork is near impossible,
but I'm sure she's with good people.

Now, this is called a living room.

And this light, you've gotta turn on and off
with this turny kind of thing.

- See?
- What I meant to say was...

-...she needs to be here with us.
- Yes, we want her here.

It wouldn't be proper.

Besides, where would you put her
in this tiny place?

Is there someone of authority
on these matters I can speak with?

There's just no getting around it. Sorry.

Let's go to the bathroom next.

This is your only bathroom.
I did go ahead and get you some bathmats...

Roger, hey. How are you?

You never called me.

I'm sorry. I've been so busy with work.

Um... Guys, this is Roger.
He works with the local police force.

We appreciate any person
who risks their life to uphold the law.

May God bless you
and keep you safe from harm.

I'll call you. Come on, guys!

Nice to meet you.

- Hey.
CARRIE: Hey, Matt.

- What's up?
- I know you have some openings in food prep...

...and it just so happens that these guys
have a lot of experience.

Okay. I'll talk to them.

Thank you.

MATT:
Hey.

So...

...what brings you to the United States?

My parents were killed in the civil war in Sudan,
and my sisters were taken as slaves.

Do you have any restaurant experience?

I would like to study to become a doctor.

That's good.

Are we going to eat now?

Sure.

MATT:
You really want me to hire these guys, Carrie?

They have no experience.
They're too strange.

If you can't take all of them,
just take one of them.

We don't have any space right now.
Check back in six months.

- Maybe something will open up.
- You're giving me that speech?

<i>_No__</i>
- I know that speech.

- You're blowing me off.
- I'm not!

You're seriously trying to tell me
that these rocket scientists...

-...are more qualified than those guys?
- Yes!

CARRIE: You're out of your mind.
- I don't think we'll get a job here.

Carrie, I'm sorry--

CARRIE:
We're leaving. Get in the car.

We get job here?

No, we're going to see Jack Forrester.

He owns the employment agency
where I work.

I'll be right back.

[CAR DOOR CLOSES]

- Hey, Jack.
JACK: Hi.

[SIGHS]

What's going on?

Welcome to the longest day of my life.

I need your help.

- You need my help?
- With work.

- Something happen in the office or something?
- Not exactly.

I have these guys from Africa, and I can't
even get them through one job interview.

- So you brought them here?
- Where else was I supposed to bring them?

You know how you make people smile.

That's it.
Potential employers want to see you smile.

You can stop now.

To smile without meaning it,
is that not insincere?

Oh, yeah. It's total bullshit.
But Americans like it...

...and that's where you live now,
so it's what you've gotta do.

Now, are any of you good with your hands?

Great, I'll make some calls.
Now, listen, this is important.

Since you have little or no experience,
you have to impress...

...upon any potential employer
how good you'd be at any given job.

But that would be a lie.

As long as you can back it up with hard work,
it's not lying.

I think Donner has some openings
for assembly line workers.

What about Nick at Star Grocery?
These two could stock shelves.

That's a good idea.
I'll call Frank, you call Nick.

Done. All right. Thanks, guys.

[cows MOOING]

You have a very beautiful village.

- Thank you. It was my father's.
- Your father was a chief?

I guess some people
would have called him that.

My father was a chief too.

May we visit with your cow?

- Be my guest.
- Are there any dangerous animals...

-...of which we should be warned?
- Such as?

Lions.

No. There's no lions here. You're safe.

[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

Man, I wish they wouldn't do that.

What's their story anyway?

I'm not sure.
They seem pretty traumatized.

When I dropped them off
the other night I said goodbye...

...they looked at me
like they were never gonna see me again.

You can't get involved in their problems.
We'll just end up in a lawsuit or something.

Yeah.

Not much has changed around here.

I've been meaning to paint the porch.

I should probably get them back.
It's getting late.

- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

WOMAN: This probably seems
overwhelming at first...

...but I promise you in no time
you'll get the hang of it.

You'll kind of have to in this section
because people can never find their cereal...

...even when it's right in front of them.

So memorize the names
and where all the different boxes go.

And some of these brands
have up to 12 different flavors.

It's a lot, but you'll get it.
Do you guys have any questions?

You don't say a whole lot.
Okay. You're shy. That's cool.

Follow me this way.
Where are you guys from anyway?

- Sudan.
WOMAN: Hmm.

So this is the dog food section,
and you have to restock it...

...all the time,
and the bags can be really heavy.

Food for dogs?

Mike? Jerry?

Mike! Jerry!

Grab these couple of carts.
Push them out back with me.

Roll them down right here.

Okay.

This is where you throw the old food so you
can restock the shelves with the new food.

Old food?

When the food expires, it's not safe to eat.

Plus it's a big headache with the health
department. Believe me, it's better this way.

Isn't there someone
who might want or need this food?

I don't sell the food inside the store
to give it away outside. I'm a businessman.

Anyway, it's none of your concern.

Now today we're working
on a hand shower with multiple spray settings.

Just got a big order from a hotel chain.

All right, training table's this way.
Let's get you a little practice.

This is the faucet assembly.
Look at all the different parts, okay?

Go ahead. Hold it in your hand,
familiarize yourself with everything.

Every part here is made and assembled
in the U.S. Something we're very proud of.

Holy cow.

It work like this?

Yeah. You bet.

- So why don't you tell me what happened?
- I'm sorry if I bring you dishonor.

But I cannot do a job
I believe in my heart is wrong.

You don't bring me dishonor personally...

...but this company did vouch for you,
and it is a big deal.

Let me explain something to you.
In America, we have this thing called bosses.

Sometimes they're just assholes. And they
have too much power for their tiny brains.

And they get really angry when you don't follow
their orders. But you have to put up with it...

...because you need money
to live and to eat and to go to school.

So I'm gonna try and get you more job
interviews. It's not gonna be easy.

Come on, I'll give you a ride.

- You are Carrie's boss.
- Heh. Nobody's Carrie's boss.

Oh, this is a very fine car.

Thank you.

May I ask, what credential
is required to drive a car?

You need a driver's license.
You practice, and then you pass a test.

[TIRES SQUEALING]

JACK: Oh, slow down! Slow down!
Left, left, okay, nowjust stop-- Whoa!

Hold on, put on the brakes!
Brakes! Brakes!

- You okay?
JEREMIAH: Oh...

JACK:
I think you should just stick to walking.

Having all read Huckleberry <i>Finn,</i>
can anyone tell me what "the good lie" means?

Huck uses lies to survive
in undesirable situations.

Exactly. But later in the book,
the lies change. How so?

They change because Huck changes.

Yes. Keep going.

When he tells the slave hunters
that he has no slaves, his lie is credible.

So he lies well.
But what is more important...

...is that it is an unselfish lie,
because it saves Jim.

Jim's freedom means more to Huck
than the money he would get for turning him in.

So it is a good lie.

Could not have said it better.

Let us turn to chapter 19, page 108.

"Here is the way we put in the time.

It was a monstrous big river down there,
sometimes a mile and a half wide."

Where have you been?

What is wrong with your eyes?

Nothing.

You could have an infection.

Let me look. Let me see.

Stop pretending
you're something you're not, Mamere.

You're not a doctor.

You're not Theo.

We are in America now,
and in America we are nothing.

That is not true.

You think you're so smart
that we want all you want.

We don't. I don't.

- Then what do you want?
- I don't want this!

I don't want to work so I can be, what...?

Be alone? Be nobody?

Paul.

[SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

I'm sorry, dude. I gotta ask.

- What happened?
PAUL: This?

A lion.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

- I'm serious, a lion.
- Okay. Yeah, it was a lion. From Africa.

Come on.

The smell of this lion
was very sweet like rain.

That was a surprise to me.

He put his mouth onto the leg of my brother.

I tried to pull the lion off...

...but it clawed me.

Whoa, man. You're serious.

Lions do not leave the bones
of their meals the way vultures does.

They take it with them...

...to their family...

...and share them.

Sometime I wonder...

...where is that lion who ate my brother?

Would I know him if I saw him?

Would he know me?

[KICKING]

[TIRES SCREECH THEN HORN HONKS]

He didn't punch out?

Wait, you're saying he's done this before?

Yeah, I'm gonna get right into it.

Okay. I'll call you back. Bye.

<i>Hey-</i>

You did not call first.

- Ha-ha-ha. Busted.

What are you guys doing out here?
It's freezing.

We miss seeing the stars.

I'm looking for Paul. Have you seen him?

May we invite you in for some tea?

You know how to play dominoes?

Uh, no.

I teach you.

Okay.

MAMERE:
Paul comes home very late or not at all.

Spends many days and nights
away from us.

Doing what?

I don't know.

Did something happen?

Lately Paul has not been Paul.

- He's your younger brother, right?
- We do not share the same mother or father.

- Oh, I didn't know.
- There is only me and my sister, Abital.

Oh. Is that the girl on the fridge?

- Yes.
- Where is she?

INS sent her to Boston.

Because there is not one family
that wanted her here in Kansas City.

Why?

It's difficult for us to talk about.

Because there was nothing I could do.

Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?

What do you have to say?

- Nothing.
- Nothing?

You bring shame upon us
and you say nothing?

You have been given a chance at life
that was taken from your brothers in Africa.

And this is what you do with it?
How could you forget?

No, it is you who forget. Who gave you life,
Mamere? Do you remember? I do.

Do not tell me what I remember.

PAUL:
I remember everything! Everything!

You did not deserve to come here!
Your brothers died so you could leave!

No, Theo died so you could leave.
Theo didn't want us to stop.

He knew it was unsafe. But you made him.
You put us in danger.

[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

You should have stood up on that grass
that day, not Theo. I saw everything!

- Guys. You gotta--
- This has nothing to do with you.

This is not your war. I'm still your chief.

You're not my chief. I know.
We all know. You killed Theo.

You are not my chief!
You have never been my chief!

CARRIE:
Oh, my God! Get off of him!

JEREMIAH:

You are not my chief!
You are not my chief!

Mamere, are you okay?

[GRUNTS]

Don't look at me.

JACK:
Who's there?

Hello?

My God, you're half frozen.

I want to see my cows.

I cannot make it stop, Jack.

- What can't you make stop?
- I can't make it stop.

Sit down.

It's my fault. It's all my fault.

What's your fault?

I let my brother be taken away
by soldiers instead of me.

They took him away thinking he was me.

Theo told these soldiers he was all alone.

To protect us. To protect me.

- It should have been me. I know this.
- You don't know that, Mamere.

Look at me.

I was in the Army. I have been to war.

But most of us were just average guys...

...being faced with unimaginable things...

...being asked to make choices
no one should have to make.

Your brother made a choice
that night that was only his to make.

It wasn't your choice.

You didn't have that power.
You never did.

I still hear the sounds of guns
and the crying of children.

The cries...

There were so many, Jack.

I want you to be my brother, not my chief.

No more.

We have an opening in three months.

Oh, no, I'm not leaving here
until I see a supervisor.

If you'll step to the side and wait
until I help everyone in line here--

I'm not stepping to the side
and I'm not waiting any more.

Now, who do I have to screw around here
to see a goddamn immigration supervisor?

Uh... Me.

Great.

Thanks, cupcake.

REED: Name?
CARRIE: Abital Deng. D-E-N-G.

- Age?
- She's probably 21.

Probably? Where is she from?

Sudan.

That's gonna be a problem.
Sudan has sponsored terrorist activity.

We're not gonna be able to move her
across state lines so easily.

We're talking about a kid here.
She's a child refugee of war.

I know. It's absurd.

But she's caught in a bureaucratic crossfire,
and it's gonna take a while.

What can I do to make it move faster?

You could hire a good immigration lawyer.

But if you're telling me the reason
they were separated...

...is because there was no host family here
for her, then you're going to have to find one.

Otherwise, there's no chance.

CARRIE: I'm just wondering
what you think of this room.

Whether I could turn it into a bedroom...

...maybe fix it up,
get rid of some of this stuff.

I'm wondering if you think
it'd be good enough...

...for the INS to approve me
hosting a refugee?

Or if your agency
would even back me up on that?

If you can get the whole house presentable,
and not just this room, yeah.

- I think you can get approval.
- What's wrong with the rest of the house?

Really?

All right. So where do we begin?

Why don't you make us some coffee?

- I have tequila.
- Praise the Lord.

Great.

We may not know the exact day we were born,

Our mothers told us.

Our mothers were very tall,
liked to tell us stories.

We remember her words, even if we do not

Mm. This reminds me
of when I was a little girl.

My sister and I used to sneak downstairs
when our parents were asleep...

...and we'd steal all the ice cream
and eat all of it.

Is she like you, your sister?

No.

She was nice.

My mom used to say that I was born
pissed off and Kelly was born chipper.

"Chipper"?

Happy. She was always happy.

I used to tease her.
I used to call her Chipper.

She hated it.

Where is she?

Oh, she got cancer two years ago, and, uh...

It just ripped through her like a firestorm.

And then, ahem, one day she was just gone.

And you wonder why it was her
and not you?

- What?
- My brother is doing laundry?

You are good to marry.
Ha-ha-ha!

I got a letter from Kenya yesterday,
and I'm not sure what to believe.

What?

A man came into the camp a month
ago looking for us.

It is possible he might have taken
our names off the list of people...

...who have immigrated in order
to pretend he's someone we know.

It is not possible.

But what if it is?

What if it's really him and he's alive?

Theo.

I don't understand. He's a refugee of war.
He needs asylum.

All flights from the Kakuma Refugee Camp
have been stopped since 9/11.

They have thousands there
waiting for the same opportunity.

But he has his family here.
Faith Based Charities is ready to step in.

I'll sponsor him. I'll pay for his ticket.
He can live with me.

We could get him a work visa.
He knows cattle.

You know, this might not even be
your brother, Mamere.

There have been people who faked their
identities just to get out of situations like this.

Which is why I need to go
and see for myself.

Cat, could you give us a second, please?

Thank you.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

You could try some embassy shopping.

- Explain that.
REED: Okay.

You go to Nairobi, you get into every embassy
you can and ask for asylum.

You tell them your brother's story.
And you see if you can get a country...

...in good standing with the U.S.
to write him a visa. Okay?

So he has to go halfway
around the world to do this?

Yes.

And it will all hinge on hitting
the right embassy on the right day.

Providing that happens,
then we can work on transferring...

...the paperwork
through diplomatic channels.

[CROWD APPLAUDING]

[CLEARS THROAT]

This is the story of my brothers and sisters.

When we were children, our fathers
said, "Let something of me survive."

<i>We did not even know what does it mean.</i>

<i>But then we saw our family murdered...</i>

...and our villages destroyed,
and then we understood.

We held inside ourselves the memories
of our forefathers and their teachings...

...so that we could move forward in the world.

Like an invisible bridge their memory connects
our old life with our new.

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

JEREMIAH: They say we were saved
by coming to the United States.

But we also saved each other.

<i>And although our differences
may divide us...</i>

<i>For we are brothers and sisters, all of us.</i>

<i>We try to share this wonderful world
we call home.</i>
