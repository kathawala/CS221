ROGERS: On your left.

On your left.

MAN: Uh-huh. On my left. Got it.

Don't say it. Don't you say it.

- On your left.
- Come on!

(PANTING) Oh!

(GROANING)

Need a medic?

(LAUGHS)

I need a new set of lungs.

Dude, you just ran, like,

I guess I got a late start.

(CHUCKLES) Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

You should take another lap.

Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

What unit you with?


But now I'm working down at the VA.

- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

I kind of put that together.
(PANTING)

Must have freaked you out, coming home
after the whole defrosting thing.

(SIGHS)
It takes some getting used to.

It's good to meet you, Sam.

It's your bed, right?

What's that?

Your bed, it's too soft.

When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

use rock for pillows,
like a caveman.

Now I'm home, lying in
my bed, and it's like...

Lying on a marshmallow.

Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

How long?

Two tours.

You must miss the
good old days, huh?

Well, things aren't so bad.

Food's a lot better. We
used to boil everything.

No polio is good.

Internet, so helpful.

I've been reading that a
lot, trying to catch up.

Marvin Gaye, 1972,
<i>Trouble Man</i> soundtrack.

Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

I'll put it on the list.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

If that's what you
want to call running.

Oh, that's how it is?

- Oh, that's how it is.
- Okay. (LAUGHS)

Any time you want to stop by
the VA, make me look awesome

in front of the girl at the
front desk, just let me know.

- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

Hey, fellas.

Either one of you know
where the Smithsonian is?

I'm here to pick up a fossil.

ROGERS: That's hilarious.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

- How you doing?
- Hey.

Can't run everywhere.

No, you can't.

(TYRES SCREECHING)

Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

They were sending up their last
payload when pirates took them,


- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

- ROGERS: Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

So it's not off-course.
It's trespassing.

I'm sure they have a good reason.

You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

Relax. It's not that complicated.

How many pirates?


Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE,
Action Division.

He's at the top of
Interpol's Red Notice.

Before the French demobilised
him, he had 36 kill missions.

This guy's got a rep for
maximum casualties.

Hostages?

Oh, mostly techs.
One officer. Jasper Sitwell.

They're in the galley.

What's Sitwell doing
on a launch ship?

All right, I'm gonna sweep
the deck and find Batroc.

Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

get them to the life-pods,
get them out. Let's move.

S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard
the Cap. Gear up.

Secure channel seven.

Seven secure.

Did you do anything
fun Saturday night?

Well, all the guys from my
barbershop quartet are dead,

so, no, not really.

<i>MALE PILOT ON RADIO:
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

You know, if you ask Kristen out, from
Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

That's why I don't ask.

Too shy, or too scared?

Too busy!

Was he wearing a parachute?

No.

No, he wasn't.

Ahh!

Ahh!

(SPLASHES)

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Hey!

(SCREAMS)

(GRUNTING)

- (COCKS GUN)
- (SPEAKS FRENCH)

Don't move.

Thanks.

Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

What about the nurse that lives
across the hall from you?

She seems kind of nice.

Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

I'm multi-tasking.

(FRENCH PIRATE SPEAKING FRENCH)

<i>I told Batroc...</i>

If we want to make
S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

start sending them bodies now!

I have a bullet for someone...

You want a bullet in your head?

Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head...?

Huh?

(BATROC SPEAKING FRENCH)

I don't like waiting.

Call Durand.

I want this ship ready to
move when the ransom comes.

(RADIO PIRATE SPEAKING FRENCH)

Start the engines.

Okay.

Hey, sailor.

(SCREAMS)

(CHOKING)

(PIRATE SPEAKING FRENCH)

Shut up.

You want to be a hero? Is that it?

All right, I've
waited long enough...

Hey!

Find Batroc...

IF I don't hear anything
in two minutes...

I start killing them!

I'll Find him.

Two minutes.

Radio silence from
S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

Targets acquired.

S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

Natasha, what's your status?

<i>Status, Natasha.</i>

Hang on!

(GROANING)

Engine room secure.

(PIRATE SPEAKING FRENCH)

Time is up.

Who dies first...?

You!

Get that one.

On my mark.

<i>Three...</i>

<i>Two... One.</i>

- (GUNFIRE)
- (PIRATES GASP)

I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D.
doesn't negotiate.

(RADIO PIRATE SPEAKING FRENCH)

The line just went dead.

I've lost contact with them...

Ahh!

Hostages en route to extraction.

<i>Romanoff missed the
rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

(PANTING)
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

Circle back to Rumlow and
protect the hostages.

Natasha.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

I thought you were more
than just a shield...

Let's see.

(PANTING)

ROMANOFF: Well, this is awkward.

What are you doing?

Backing up the hard drive.

It's a good habit to get into.

Rumlow needed your help.

What the hell are you doing here?

You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

Whatever I can get my hands on.

Our mission is to rescue hostages.

No, that's your mission,

and you've done it beautifully.

You just jeopardised
this whole operation.

I think that's overstating things.

(BOTH GROANING)

(BOTH PANTING)

Okay.

That one's on me.

You're damn right.

(SIGHS)

ROGERS: You just can't stop
yourself from lying, can you?

FURY: I didn't lie.

Agent Romanoff had a different
mission than yours.

Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.

I'm not obliged to do anything.

Those hostages could
have died, Nick.

I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

Not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns.

Last time I trusted
someone, I lost an eye.

Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

I can't lead a mission

when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

It's called compartmentalisation.

Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

Except you.

You're wrong about me.

I do share.

I'm nice like that.

Insight bay.

<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. COMPUTER:

Fury, Nicholas J.

<i>- Confirmed.</i>
- (DOOR CLOSES)

You know, they used to play music.

Yeah.

My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

Granddad worked in a nice building.

Got good tips.

He'd walk home every night, a roll
of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

He'd say, "Hi."

People would say, "Hi" back.

Time went on, the
neighbourhood got rougher.

He'd say, "Hi."

They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

Did he ever get mugged?

(LAUGHS)

Every week some punk would
say, "What's in the bag?"

What would he do?

He'd show them.

Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

Yeah, Granddad loved people.

But he didn't trust them very much.

Yeah, I know.

They're a little bit
bigger than a .22.

FURY: This is Project Insight.

Three next-generation helicarriers

synced to a network of
targeting satellites.

Launched from the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

Stark?

He had a few suggestions

once he got an up-close
look at our old turbines.

These new long-range precision guns

can eliminate 1,000
hostiles a minute.

The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

We're gonna neutralise a lot of
threats before they even happen.

Thought the punishment usually
came after the crime.

We can't afford to wait that long.

Who's "we"?

After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

For once, we're way
ahead of the curve.

By holding a gun to everyone on
Earth and calling it protection.

You know, I read those SSR files.

"Greatest Generation"?

You guys did some nasty stuff.

Yeah, we compromised.

Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

But we did it so that
people could be free.

This isn't freedom. This is fear.

S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as
it is, not as we'd like it to be.

And it's getting damn near past time for
you to get with that programme, Cap.

Don't hold your breath.

My only regret is that you

What is it?

For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.

And I thought I could throw
myself back in and follow orders.

Serve.

It's just not the same.

(LAUGHS) You're always so dramatic.

Look, you saved the world.

We rather mucked it up.

You didn't.

Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

Hey.

The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

All we can do is our best.

And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

(COUGHING)

Yeah?

(GASPS)

You're alive.

You came back.

This failure is unacceptable.

Considering this attack took place

one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

We don't need hearings,
we need action.

It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

A breach like this raises
serious questions.

Like how the hell
did a French pirate

manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

I can draw a map if it'd help.

I appreciate your wit,
Secretary Pierce.

But this Council takes things like
international piracy fairly seriously.

Really? I don't.

I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

If this Council is going
to fall to rancour

every time someone pushes
us on the playing field,

maybe we need someone
to oversee us.

YEN: Mr Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...

Excuse me.

More trouble, Mr Secretary?

PIERCE: Depends on your definition.

(DOOR OPENING)

I work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit?

A nuclear war would do it, too.

You busy in there?

Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

I'm here to ask a favour.

I want you to call for a vote.

Project Insight has to be delayed.

Nick, that's not a favour,

that's a sub-committee
hearing. A long one.

It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

I just need time to
make sure it's nothing.

But if it's something?

Then we'll both be damn glad those
helicarriers aren't in the air.

Fine.

But you got to get Iron Man to
stop by my niece's birthday party.

Thank you, sir.

And not just a flyby.
He's got to mingle.

<i>GARCIA: The thing is,</i>

I think it's getting worse.

A cop pulled me over last week.

He thought I was drunk.

I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

I thought it was an IED.

WILSON: Some stuff you leave there.

Other stuff you bring back.

It's our job to figure
out how to carry it.

Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

It's up to you.

- Definitely.

Look who it is, the running man.

So, hell yeah.

Are you thinking about getting out?

No.

To be honest, I don't know what I

I'm Alexander Pierce.

Sir, it's an honour.

The honour's mine, Captain.

My father served in
the 101st. Come on in.

PIERCE: That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

when I was at State
Department in Bogota.

E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

Nick was Deputy Chief of the
S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

and he comes to me with a plan.

He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.

I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

They find it empty.

Nick had ignored my direct order,

and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,

including my daughter.

So you gave him a promotion.

I've never had any
cause to regret it.

Captain, why was Nick in
your apartment last night?

I don't know.

Did you know it was bugged?

I did, because Nick told me.

Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

I want you to see something.

<i>INTERROGATOR:
Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

Is that live?

Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

ROGERS:
Are you saying he's a suspect?

Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

PIERCE: No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

The last one going
to a holding company

that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

Am I supposed to know who that is?

Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.

His last address was

When I first met Nick, his
mother lived at 1437.

Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

The prevailing theory

was that the hijacking was a
cover for the acquisition

and sale of classified
intelligence.

The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

Why do you think we're talking?

See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

to build a really better world

sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.

And that makes enemies.

Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts

to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.

And the idea that those
people could be happy today

makes me really, really angry.

Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

I don't think that's an accident.

And I don't think you do, either.

So, I'm gonna ask again.

Why was he there?

He told me not to trust anyone.

PIERCE:
I wonder if that included him.

I'm sorry.

Those were his last words.

Excuse me.

Captain,

somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

Anyone.

What's the status so far?

- MAN: Administrations level.
<i>- COMPUTER: Confirmed.</i>

Excuse me.

It's messed up, what
happened to him.

It kind of feels personal.

He's headed for the garage.

<i>PILOT: Stand down, Captain
Rogers. Stand down.</i>

<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

SITWELL: Eyes here.

Whatever your op is, bury it.

This is Level One.

Contact DOT.

All traffic lights in

Shut all runways at BWI,

IAD and Reagan.

All security cameras in the city go

Scan all open sources,

phones, computers,

PDAs. Whatever.

If someone tweets about this guy,

I want to know about it.

With all due respect, if
S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

PIERCE: Because he lied to us.

Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

He refused to share it.

As difficult as this is to accept,

Captain America is a
fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

- Where is it?
- Safe.

- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

Why would I tell you?

Fury gave it to you. Why?

- What's on it?
- I don't know.

Stop lying.

I only act like I know
everything, Rogers.

I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

I'm not gonna ask you again.

I know who killed Fury.

Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

The ones that do call
him the Winter Soldier.

He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

in the last 50 years.

So he's a ghost story.

Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

Somebody shot out my
tyres near Odessa.

We lost control, went
straight over a cliff.

I pulled us out.

But the Winter Soldier was there.

I was covering my
engineer so he shot him

straight through me.

Soviet slug.

No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them now.

Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

Like you said, he's a ghost story.

Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

<i>PIERCE: Nick Fury was
murdered in cold blood.</i>

To any reasonable person,

that would make him a
martyr, not a traitor.

ROCKWELL:
You know what makes him a traitor?

Hiring a mercenary to
hijack his own ship.

SINGH:
Nick Fury used your friendship

to coerce this Council into
delaying Project Insight.

A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

At best, he lied
to you. At worst...

Are you calling for my resignation?

I've got a pen and
paper right here.

That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.

But you do want to
have a discussion?

We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

This Council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.

If you want to say something
snappy, now would be a good time.

First rule of going on the
run is don't run, walk.

If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

How much time will we have?

About nine minutes from

now.

ROMANOFF:
Fury was right about that ship.

Somebody's trying
to hide something.

This drive is protected
by some sort of Al.

It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

Can you override it?

The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

Slightly.

I'm gonna try running a tracer.

This is a program that
S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

to track hostile malware,

so if we can't read the file,

maybe we can find out
where it came from.

Can I help you guys with anything?

Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping
me with some honeymoon destinations.

Right. We're getting married.

Congratulations. Where are you
guys thinking about going?

- New Jersey.
- Oh.

I have the exact same glasses.

Wow, you two are practically twins.

Yeah, I wish.

Specimen.

If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

Thank you.

- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

Got it.

You know it?

I used to. Let's go.

Standard tac team.

Two behind, two across,

If they make us, I'll engage, you hit

Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

- What?
- Do it.

- Kiss me.
- What?

Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

Yes, they do.

You still uncomfortable?

It's not exactly the
word I would use.

Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

- Nazi Germany.
- Mmm.

And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

I feel like, if you
don't answer it though,

- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

Was that your first
kiss since 1945?

- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

No, I didn't.

I just wondered how much
practice you've had.

- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

It was not my first
kiss since 1945.

I'm 95, I'm not dead.

Nobody special, though?

(CHUCKLES)

Believe it or not,
it's kind of hard

to find someone with
shared life experience.

Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

- What, like you?
- I don't know.

The truth is a matter
of circumstance.

It's not all things to all
people, all the time.

Neither am I.

That's a tough way to live.

It's a good way not to die, though.

You know, it's kind of
hard to trust someone,

when you don't know who
that someone really is.

Yeah.

Who do you want me to be?

How about a friend?

Well, there's a chance you might
be in the wrong business, Rogers.

ROGERS: This is it.

The file came from
these coordinates.

So did I.

This camp is where I was trained.

Change much?

A little.

DRILL SERGEANT:
Pick up the pace, ladies!

Let's go! Let's go!

Double time!

Come on, Rogers, move it!

Come on, fall in!

Rogers!

I said fall in!

ROMANOFF: This is a dead end.

Zero heat signatures, zero
waves, not even radio.

Whoever wrote the file must have
used a router to throw people off.

What is it?

ROGERS: Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

within 500 yards of the barracks.

This building is in
the wrong place.

ROMANOFF: This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

Maybe where it started.

And there's Stark's father.

ROGERS: Howard.

Who's the girl?

If you're already working
in a secret office,

why do you need to
hide the elevator?

<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

<i>born 1918.</i>

<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

<i>born 1984.</i>

It's some kind of recording.

<i>I am not a recording, Fräulein.</i>

<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

<i>when the Captain took
me prisoner in 1945.</i>

<i>But I am.</i>

You know this thing?

ROGERS: Arnim Zola was a German
scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

He's been dead for years.

<i>ZOLA: First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

<i>Second, look around you.</i>

<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

<i>In 1972, I received a
terminal diagnosis.</i>

<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

- ROGERS: How did you get here?
<i>- Invited.</i>

It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German
scientists with strategic value.

<i>ZOLA: They thought I
could help their cause.</i>

<i>I also helped my own.</i>

ROGERS:
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

<i>Cut off one head, two more
shall take its place.</i>

Prove it.

<i>Accessing archive.</i>

<i>HYDRA was founded on the
belief that humanity</i>

<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

<i>What we did not realise
was that if you try</i>

<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

<i>The war taught us much.</i>

<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

<i>After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,</i>

<i>and I was recruited.</i>

<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

<i>A beautiful parasite
inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

<i>For 70 years,</i>

<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

<i>history was changed.</i>

That's impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D.
would have stopped you.

<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

<i>to gain its security.</i>

<i>Once a purification
process is complete,</i>

<i>HYDRA's new world order will arise.</i>

<i>We won, Captain.</i>

<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

Not everyone.

- You okay?
- Yeah.

What's going on?

When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

But I guess I just traded
in the KGB for HYDRA.

(SIGHS)

I thought I knew whose
lies I was telling,

but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.

There's a chance you might

I owe you.

It's okay.

If it was the other way around,

and it was down to me
to save your life,

now you be honest with me,

would you trust me to do it?

I would now.

And I'm always honest.

Well, you seem pretty chipper

for someone who just found
out they died for nothing.

Well, guess I just like
to know who I'm fighting.

WILSON: I made breakfast.

If you guys eat that sort of thing.

So, the question is,

who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

Pierce.

Who happens to be sitting on top of the
most secure building in the world.

But he's not working alone.

Zola's algorithm was
on the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

So was Jasper Sitwell.

So, the real question is, how
do the two most wanted people

in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D.
officer in broad daylight?

The answer is, you don't.

- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

Is this Bakhmala?

The Khalid Khandil
mission, that was you?

You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

ROMANOFF: I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

What did you use? A stealth chute?

No.

These.

I thought you said
you were a pilot.

I never said pilot.

I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

You got out for a good reason.

Dude, Captain America
needs my help.

There's no better
reason to get back in.

Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?

The last one is at Fort Meade.

Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

Shouldn't be a problem.

Listen, I got to fly home tonight

because I got some
constituency problem

and I got to press the flesh.

Any constituent in
particular, Mr Senator?

Oh, no, not really.

Twenty-three, kind of hot.

Real hot, you know?

Wants to be a reporter,
I think. I don't know.

Who listens at that point?

Doesn't sound like much
of a problem to me.

Really? Because she's
killing my back.

But this isn't the place
to talk about it.

This is a nice pin.

- Thank you.

Is this little display meant to insinuate

It's hers.

Zola's algorithm is a program

You!

A TV anchor in Cairo, the
Under Secretary of Defence,

a high school Valedictorian
in Iowa City,

Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

to HYDRA.

Now, or in the future.

In the future? How could it know?

(LAUGHING)

How could it not?

The 21st century is a digital book.

Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

Your bank records,

medical histories, voting patterns,

emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

to predict their future.

And what then?

Oh, my God. Pierce
is gonna kill me.

What then?

Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

A few million at a time.

SITWELL: HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

Insight's launching in 16 hours.

We're cutting it a
little bit close here.

I know. We'll use him
to bypass the DNA scans

and access the

Banner developed it for stress.

Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

Can't kill you if
you're already dead.

Besides,

I wasn't sure who to trust.

Sergeant Barnes.

Bucky, no!

(BUCKY SCREAMING)

<i>ZOLA:
The procedure has already started.</i>

<i>You are to be the
new fist of HYDRA.</i>

<i>Put him on ice.</i>

Sir.

(STAMMERS) He's unstable.

Erratic.

Mission report.

Mission report now.

The man on the bridge.

(INAUDIBLE)

Who was he?

You met him earlier this
week on another assignment.

I knew him.

Your work has been
a gift to mankind.

You shaped the century.

And I need you to do
it one more time.

Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

But, if you don't do your
part, I can't do mine.

And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

But I knew him.

(SIGHS)

PIERCE: Prep him.

He's been out of cryo
freeze too long.

Then wipe him and start over.

(SCREAMING)

This man declined the
Nobel Peace Prize.

He said peace wasn't
an achievement,

it was a responsibility.

See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

We have to stop the launch.

I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.

What's that?

Once the helicarriers
reach 3,000 feet,

they'll triangulate with Insight
satellites, becoming fully weaponised.

FURY:
We need to breach those carriers

and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

HILL: One or two won't cut it.

We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

a whole lot of people
are gonna die.

We have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is HYDRA.

We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

And maybe, just maybe we
can salvage what's left...

ROGERS:
We're not salvaging anything.

We're not just taking
down the carriers, Nick.

We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing
to do with this.

You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

HYDRA grew right under your
nose and nobody noticed.

Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

How many paid the
price before you did?

Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

ROGERS: Even if you had,
would you have told me?

Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?

S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

it all goes.

HILL: He's right.

WILSON: Don't look at me.

I do what he does, just slower.

Well...

(SIGHS)

It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

<i>BUCKY: We looked for you, after.</i>

(CHURCH BELL TOLLING)

<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

I know, I'm sorry. I just
kind of wanted to be alone.

How was it?

It was okay.

She's next to Dad.

I was gonna ask...

I know what you're gonna
say, Buck. I just...

BUCKY: We can put the couch
cushions on the floor

like when we were kids.

It'll be fun. All you got
to do is shine my shoes,

maybe take out the trash.

Come on.

Thank you, Buck, but I
can get by on my own.

The thing is, you don't have to.

I'm with you to the
end of the line, pal.

(SIGHS)

He's gonna be there, you know.

I know.

Look, whoever he used to
be and the guy he is now,

I don't think he's
the kind you save.

He's the kind you stop.

I don't know if I can do that.

Well, he might not
give you a choice.

He doesn't know you.

He will.

Gear up. It's time.

You gonna wear that?

No. If you're gonna fight a
war, you got to wear a uniform.

Oh, man.

I am so fired.

<i>ROGERS ON PA:
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

<i>You've heard a lot about
me over the last few days.</i>

<i>Some of you were even
ordered to hunt me down.</i>

But I think it's time
you know the truth.

S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

It's been taken over by HYDRA.

<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight
crew are HYDRA as well.</i>

<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

but I know they're in the building.

<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

<i>Absolute control.</i>

They shot Nick Fury.

<i>And it won't end there.</i>

If you launch those
helicarriers today,

<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

<i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i>

And it's a price I'm
willing to pay.

And if I'm the only
one, then so be it.

But I'm Willing to bet I'm not.

Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

You smug son of a bitch.

Arrest him.

I guess I've got the floor.

Preempt the launch sequence.

Um...

Because I thought
you had me killed.

You know how the game works.

So why make me head
of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

Because you were the best,

and the most ruthless
person I ever met.

I did what I did to protect people.

Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

Disorder. War.

It's just a matter of time before
a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

or an EMP fries Chicago.

Diplomacy?

A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

And you know where I
learned that. Bogota.

You didn't ask. You just
did what had to be done.

I can bring order to the lives

I think the wreck in the

made his point fairly eloquently.

COMMITTEE MEMBER:
Well, he could explain how

this country is expected to
maintain its national security

now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

HYDRA was selling you
lies, not intelligence.

Many of which you seemed to have
had a personal hand in telling.

Agent, you should know

that there are some
on this committee

who feel, given your
service record,

both for this country
and against it,

that you belong in a penitentiary.

Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

You're not going to
put me in a prison.

You're not going to put any of
us in a prison. You know why?

Do enlighten us.

<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

<i>But we're also the ones best

There's something I

How about you, Wilson? Could
use a man with your abilities.

I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

All right, then.

Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.

You should be honoured. That's
about as close as he gets

to saying thank you.

No.

- Not staying here.
- Nah.

I blew all my covers. I got

That might take a while.

That thing you asked for,

I called in a few

Will you do me a favour?

She's not a nurse.

And you're not a

Be careful, Steve.

You might not want to

You're going after him.

You don't have to come with me.

It's over. Fury has released

HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

Two sides of a coin that's
no longer currency.

What we have

is worth more than any
of them ever knew.

We've only scratched the
surface and already,

there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

and keep them off our scent.

What about the volunteers?

The dead will be buried so deep

their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

And the survivors?

The twins.

Sooner or later,
they will meet the twins.

It's not a world of spies any more.

Not even a world of heroes.

This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.

There's nothing more horrifying

than a miracle.
