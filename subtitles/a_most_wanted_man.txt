Yes, Maxi.

- GUNTHER: Maxi? What have you got?
- Yeah?

Around 11:00 a.m. police received a report

about a suspicious figure
in the central train station.

They were sent this image
taken from a mobile phone.

The quality's not great
but good enough to make a match.

Karpov, lssa.

Chechen, 26.

Classified as an escaped militant jihadist.

- GUNTHER: Hmm.
- MAXIMILIAN: Potentially violent.

Approach with caution.

Pull that down.

MAXIMILIAN: Security footage has
him returning to the station

five times during the day.

GUNTHER: Do we know that guy?

NIKI: Not yet. Working on it.

- Ah. Give me the hands.
- MAXIMILIAN: Uh-huh.

RASHEED: Some sort of note?

Currency maybe.

MAXIMILIAN: That's our last sight of him.

GUNTHER: Who else knows he's out there?

NIKI: The cops haven't made a connection.

Mmm. And upstairs?

Mmm-mmm, doesn't look like it.

If not yet they will soon.

Karl, Rasheed, start with the mosques,

Niki, try the railway station.

Find out who the hell
that scrawny bastard is.

NIKI: Mmm-hmm.

Great.

Thank you.

Issa Karpov.

A Muslim first name and
a Russian last name.

What does that tell us?

That the boy is confused.

Karpov, the Russian, he's ours.

Am I to understand you've found him?

I remind you that your license

I am co-operating, Dieter.

I want this kid to talk to whoever
he was told to talk to,

I don't want anybody else getting close

(SCOFFS) It's in your hands, Gunther.

Thank Christ it's not in yours

- because if it was you'd fuck it up.
- Mmm-hmm.

Then I want it in writing,

Enough to keep waiting.

Don't underestimate Mohr.

He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.

Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.

usually aren't much use to me.

What about women?

This is my colleague lrna Frey.

- Hello.
- Hello.

She sails and spies.

I don't sail.

Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.

What are you doing here?

Me? I am just an observer.

I have been observed by Americans before.

It usually doesn't end well.

From what I'm hearing, we're not the ones

you need to be worrying about.

OTTO: Good morning, everyone.

<i>Herr</i> Mohr has compiled a report.

Our investigations confirm

that lssa Karpov

is a member of a militant Salafi group
of Chechen jihadists.

Karpov was arrested soon after the capture

of the group's leader earlier this year.

Where did this information come from?

We have excellent resources
inside the Russian state security system.

After 24 hours of questioning,
Karpov confessed

to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines,

transport, infrastructure, police stations.

After 24 hours of Russian questioning

any one of us would admit to anything.

Are you contesting this report?

No. Yes.

Maybe.

We've not yet had the
benefit of reading it.

(SIGHS) The report concludes that
the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg

seeking to make contact
with lslamist cells operating in the city.

They hide among us.

- Really?
- OTTO: Yes.

Karpov is a wanted man.

If you have knowledge of his whereabouts,

you are obliged to follow
due process under the constitution.

You mean arresting him?

Issa Karpov is indeed seeking
to make contact in Hamburg,

with a banker.

We've had no briefing on this.

Well, if you were doing your job,
you wouldn't need one.

We're not policemen.

We're spies.
Issa Karpov may be of value to us.

All I'm asking for is more time.

Our unit was set up to develop
intelligence resources

inside Germany's Islamic community.

- That's why we're here.
- Oh.

And I thought you were here
because you fucked up in Beirut

and your friend Michael
Axelrod had no idea...

This banker, do we know
what Karpov wants from him?

Not yet and if we move against him now,

the chances are we never will.

I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.

Maybe you should let him get on with it.

You have 72 hours to bring

this matter to a resolution,

if not, we will,
with or without your co-operation.

- OKay?
- OKay.

ANNABEL: Where should we go?

CO-WORKER: Meet at the place
on the corner?

Okay.

Uh, I'll catch up with you later.

Hello, lssa.

Uh, my name is Annabel Richter.

I am a lawyer.

I work with an organization
called Sanctuary North.

- Mmm, please?
- Okay.

Are you seeking asylum in Germany?

I make coffee.

There has to be a reason.

Either you cannot return
to your country of origin

because your life would be in danger

or you have been tortured.

Yes.

Yes, what?

I have been tortured.

Forgive me, but this is my job.

I want to believe you,
but people make this claim all the time.

I have to...

Who did this to you?

<i>Roosskie.</i>

ANNABEL: I cannot help you unless
you are honest with me.

It's only a matter of time before the
German authorities will find you.

It's better for your case
if you go to them first.

- We can make a formal...
- I will never, never go back to Russia.

Please?

You will contact this man.

He will help me.

Mr. Thomas Brue.

Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov,

stationed in Chechnya, 1986.

He was involved with organized crime.

NIKI: Big time. Drugs for arms.
White slave traffic.

You name it he was in to it.

Karpov died two years ago.

- And?
- He had a son.

Ivan.

Born, 1986 in Chechnya.

Mother unknown.

Good.

ELLI: Fraulein Richter?

Please follow me.

Please.

What exactly is Sanctuary North?

I'm a lawyer.

Our clients are people
who have left their place of birth.

They are effectively stateless.

They are often traumatized.

What is it you want, Miss Richter?

A donation?

(SIGHS)

I'm sorry.

That was insensitive.

I'm here on behalf of a client.

His name is lssa Karpov.

Is the name known to you?

Karpov?

Mmm-mmm. No.

He is in possession of a letter
written by your father to his.

It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner,

as in the Spanish horses which are
born black but gradually turn white.

Yes.

This is a process I'm guessing
your bank is familiar with?

The letter contains a number.

Does it fit?

Does it fit what?

Is the number an account reference
in use at this bank?

(SIGHS) I'm afraid my bank

doesn't broadcast the manner
in which it does its business.

I'm sure that suits your clients very well.

But if this number does pertain
to an account held at this bank,

it would have been established
quite some time ago.

I will need to check our records.

Once I have done so I will call you.

When?

My client's situation in Hamburg
is extremely sensitive Mr. Brue.

I'm sure.

He trusts you.

As, judging by the contents of
the letter, his father trusted yours.

Big boy.

Six...

Ah.


"Grigori Borisovich Karpov."

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

I'll be there.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

Uh, glass of wine?

Uh, still water please.

WAITER: Still water. Of course.

You frequent the Atlantic?

Uh...

Not your scene?

You said your client's situation
was sensitive, hence the hurry.

I can confirm that the reference number
you supplied

does pertain to an account
held at Brue Freres Bank.

Then he intends to make a claim.

Then tell him to bring a large suitcase.

Of course he will need
to establish his identity.

My client entered the country
in difficult circumstances.

He has the letter.

- I will need to see it.
- Of course.

And in addition, he will need to
provide a certain instrument.

Which is?

I'm afraid I can't say,

but if your client is legitimate

he will know what I am talking about.

And if he has this instrument?

I see no difficulty in proceeding.

She's coming out.

Attractive.

Not my type-

What is your type, Gunther?

You are, lrna. You know that.

Hello, Tommy.

<i>(GUNTHER CLEARS THROAT)</i>

Hamburg is one of
the great ports of the world, Tommy.

For centuries it opened its arms

to every foreigner
who washed up on its shores.

Now, since 9/11,

in the eyes of every dark-skinned man

we see someone who wants to kill us.

Problem is some of them do,

but the question is whether
lssa Karpov is one of them.

The lawyer.

Lawyer?

Annabel Richter.

The one you met at the hotel.
The one you'd like to fuck.

What? Not true?

You're too old for her, Tommy. We both are.

See her, love her, but
you'll never get her,

not even with all that black money

you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.

As far as I am aware,
Miss Richter represents

a client with a legitimate
financial interest with my bank.

Your bank does business
with the Russians, right?

It did. In my father's time.

Mafia?

Military mainly.

(STAMMERING) What's to stop me

from just walking away from this?

Whatever this is.

How about we start with
a full audit of your books?

But your father wasn't
just a banker, Tommy.

He was a laundryman.

You're threatening me?

Just sympathizing.

You've been left to clean up the mess.

(TAPS CIGARETTE)

Thank you for coming.

Of course.

(DOOR OPENS)

lssa.

This is Mr. Brue.

Morning.

Perhaps you could show him the letter.

"My dear Karpov,

"as discussed, please accept this letter

"as assurance from one friend to another,

"that in the unfortunate
circumstance of your death

"I should be pleased
to acquaint your own dear son,

<i>“Ivan Grigorevich Karpov,</i>

"with our friend Mr. Lipizzaner.

"He need only present this letter,

"together with the necessary instrument

<i>"currently in your
possession for me to act.</i>

<i>"In case of my own death,</i>

<i>"my son Thomas will fulfill
my promise to you."</i>

Forgive me.
It's correct signature of your father?

TOMMY: It is.

Should I address you then as lssa or Ivan?

Issa.

It's my Muslim name and I like.

But not the one your father gave you?

My mother was Chechen.

I wish, sir, with your help,

to make an honorable life in Hamburg.

Very good, (SIGHS)

but first, you understand
there are certain questions of fact.

I bring your attention
to the matter of the instrument.

May I ask how you came
to be in possession of this?

It was given to me by my father's lawyer.

So it seems I am being asked

to fulfill one father's promise to another.

It's true. Karpov was my father.

TOMMY: You weren't close?

My father was a murderer.

He has Chechen blood on his hands.

And yet you seem
willing enough to take his money?

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

(SIGHS)

I understand you came here from Turkey,

by an informal route, shall we say?

May I ask, what you were doing in Turkey?

I was in prison.

And before that?

I was in prison in Russia.

- Why?
- You don't need to answer that, lssa.

Why not?

Because it is immaterial.

To what, Fraulein Richter?

Your client...

He's your client, too, Mr. Brue.

Your client lays claim

to his father's account,

yet he has no passport,

cannot prove his identity.

(WHISPERING) He has the key and the letter,
what more do you want?

(SIGHS)

We couldn't hear everything so well, Tommy.

So exactly how much are we talking about?

(SIGHS DEEPLY) I can't tell you.

Not exactly.

A ballpark figure?


We're talking

upwards of 10 million euro.

At least.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

- Coffee.
- Yes, sir.

- Black.
- Right away.

I wasn't sure you'd come.

I want to make one thing clear.

I don't owe you anything.

What happened in Beirut?

You know what happened in Beirut.

My networks were blown.

So Hamburg is a punishment?

Depends on whether you like Hamburg.

Unless that's what you
want people to think?

Take some of the heat off you so you can

get on with the real game.

Which is?

Dr. Faisal Abdullah.

Come on, Gunther, we probably
know as much about him as you do.

What do you know, Martha?

We know you've been
watching him for months,

and we know you're under pressure
to get results.

And we know that the man moves money

through a network of Muslim charities

and every time he does,
some of it goes missing.

Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything

we want him to be and a little bit more.

He's tolerant, enlightened,
engaged with the West.

But every good man
has a little bit of bad, doesn't he?

And in Abdullah's case,

that little bit

just might kill you.

You know all that, how come he's still
walking the streets of Hamburg

and not rotting in some cell in Guantanamo?

(SIGHS)

Because we think, we don't know.

The money leaves
and we don't know where it goes.

Anyways, on German soil
he's got the protection of German law.

That hasn't stopped you before.

We don't do that anymore.

You want us to do it, then.

I'm more interested in knowing why
you haven't done it already?

(COINS JINGLING)

Please work with us on this one, Gunther.

I don't trust you.

(CHUCKLES)

Old habits die hard.

That's what I'm worried about.

I was talking about yours.

Have a nice day.

You too.

I got your text.

I...

I can't do this anymore.

Someone's going to find out. I can feel it.

I'm frightened.

They are looking at me.

All of them.

I'm done. It's over.

I am not your spy. I am a student.

You cannot make me do this.

I never made you do anything, Jamal.

And I never will.

You know that.

When we first met,

you remember what we talked about?

You remember that?

Family, the future.

Most of us don't get to
choose, but you did.

You made the right choice.

It's not easy.

But there's no going back,

We can't undo what's done.

Issa, he says the bank

You've lost Karpov, haven't you?

I need the lawyer to move freely.

I don't have that kind

We both know you have

Look, if you want me to help you on

Tell me which way you're heading.

Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.

It was carrying 1,000 tons
of donated grain bound for Djibouti.

It stopped to re-fuel
on the south coast of Yemen.

When it reached its destination
there were 900 tons left.

At the same time 100 tons of grain

mysteriously hit
the open market in the Yemen.

The money from its sale was
used to buy rocket launchers

for lslamist militants.

I think the shipping company
is an al-Qaeda front.

I think that's where the missing funds

from Abdullah's charities are going.

You think, or you know?

Come on, Gunther. Share.

Abdullah's not the bad guy.

He's our way to the bad guy.

A man supplies money
that buys weapons that kills Americans

and you're telling me he's a pal?

So maybe he's not waving
the flag of freedom and democracy

as enthusiastically as you'd like.

Okay.

- But he sees his people...
- Spare the lecture.

He sees his people
being fucked over from here to eternity.

I've heard that before, so...

Maybe a little bit of him
wants to return the favor,

but it's that little bit
that makes him so valuable.

Don't you see?

Okay. I understand.
But that's not what my people would say.

What would your people say?
Take him out? Kill him?

And then what have you got?

A great big fucking hole,
and who's going to fill it?

Nobody knows. You least of all.

So we all start looking again,

and tap-tapping around in the dark.

You want to own Abdullah,
is that what you want?

A man with your reputation
and your resources.

How are you going to do that?

Karpov has access to money.

That may be of interest to Abdullah.

And the lawyer?

He trusts her.

We see what Allah provides.

Uh, well, this time Allah has provided

lssa Karpov and his ill-gotten millions.

As you can see from the report
my team has compiled,

Dr. Abdullah has provided
an extensive list of his favorite charities

to be the recipients of those millions.

Each one of those charities
has been CIA cleared.

It is my belief he will replace

one of the names on this list with another.

Seven Friends Navigation Company.

What kind of proof can you show us?

Proof is what we're looking for.

If this Abdullah,

if this barracuda,
if I've understood the metaphor,

takes the bait,

with what leverage
will you secure his cooperation?

On the negative, uh,

threat of prosecution, prison,

uh, public humiliation,
discrediting of his charities,

um, deportation of his wife and children.

I choose the positive.

Amnesty, citizenship, for which he
has applied half a dozen times.

Now we are offering
citizenship to financiers of terror?

You are all familiar with
the operational plan?

We have three hours
to apprehend Abdullah and make him ours

and get him back home
before anyone notices.

And if he does not comply?

Then he's yours.

Do with him whatever you need to do.

And lssa Karpov?

He's to be left alone.

In my eyes it's unacceptable.

Find someone else to parade
before the cameras.

That was agreed.

He has our protection.

Martha, what is the American perspective?

Maybe if you could define for us

what you think
the long-term objective would be.

What are we trying to achieve?

To make the world a safer place.

Isn't that enough?
