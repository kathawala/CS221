<i>In the dark depths of winter,</i>

<i>a mother listens to the first sounds</i>

<i>of her brand new baby cubs.</i>

<i>Let's call this mama bear "Sky."</i>

<i>And her cubs are Scout and Amber.</i>

<i>Hi, little guys.</i>

<i>They say the first year
of parenting is the hardest.</i>

<i>Sky will soon learn that, for bears,</i>

<i>it's nearly impossible.</i>

<i>Almost half of all bear cubs</i>

<i>don't survive their first year.</i>

<i>But for now, deep inside the den,</i>

<i>they're safe.</i>

<i>It's warm and comfy.</i>

<i>And after an entire winter together,</i>

<i>it probably smells pretty bad.</i>

<i>Sky worked hard last summer,</i>

<i>eating over 90 pounds of fish a day,</i>

<i>to store up enough fat</i>

<i>to last through these early months.</i>

<i>But now she's hungry,</i>

<i>and if she doesn't eat soon,</i>

<i>the milk her cubs need will dry up.</i>

<i>There's a long, dangerous journey
ahead of them.</i>

<i>Sky needs to get her cubs
down to the coast,</i>

<i>and she hopes that the salmon
will be plentiful this summer.</i>

<i>But there's no guarantee.</i>

<i>Little Scout and Amber's
survival depends on it.</i>

<i>Okay, cuddle time is over.</i>

<i>These bears need to get on the move.</i>

<i>This is the story
of their incredible first year.</i>

<i>What an amazing place
to take your first steps.</i>

<i>These little cubs will have to be brave</i>

<i>from the second their paws
touch the snow.</i>

<i>This is the Alaska Peninsula.</i>

<i>With over five million acres</i>

<i>of protected national parkland,</i>

<i>it's home to thousands of brown bears.</i>

<i>Five months ago,</i>

<i>Sky climbed these mountains
to dig her den.</i>

<i>But now, they're her biggest obstacle.</i>

<i>They've got to get</i>

<i>all the way
across these frozen mountains</i>

<i>before they'll find
even the first hint of food.</i>

<i>Sky is clearly delighted
to be free of the smelly den.</i>

<i>"Wait up, Mom!"</i>

<i>Maybe a little too delighted.</i>

<i>Nothing like a mother's gentle touch.</i>

<i>Like a lot of new moms,</i>

<i>Sky doesn't have patience
for dawdling.</i>

<i>"Come here, you. Come here."</i>

<i>"Yikes, Mom! Not the teeth!"</i>

<i>"Oh!"</i>

<i>This doesn't hurt little Scout, but still...</i>

<i>Sky has a bit to learn
when it comes to parenting.</i>

<i>Life was certainly easier when she
was just a single bear.</i>

<i>Now, she can only go
as fast as her cubs.</i>

<i>"Come on, you guys."</i>

<i>She has good reason
to dish out a little tough love.</i>

<i>They have got an awful lot
of ground to cover.</i>

<i>And with every passing day,</i>

<i>the journey will only get harder.</i>

<i>A walk in the warm sun
on a bright, spring day</i>

<i>may seem like fun,</i>

<i>but that warmth starts the melt.</i>

<i>The snow that sheltered
them through the winter</i>

<i>becomes a deadly enemy.</i>

<i>Avalanche.</i>

<i>These massive monsters</i>

<i>reach speeds of
up to 80 miles an hour.</i>

<i>A wall of snow and ice</i>

<i>barreling over everything in its path.</i>

<i>Sky and the cubs were lucky this time,</i>

<i>but it's a good reminder
that they need to stay moving.</i>

<i>Amber's found a smart way
to keep up with her mom,</i>

<i>just hitch a ride.</i>

<i>Just gotta get that toe in there.</i>

<i>There we go.</i>

<i>But Scout, being
the more adventurous one,</i>

<i>decides to explore at his own pace.</i>

<i>They've been traveling
for over a week now,</i>

<i>and the climb is only getting steeper.</i>

<i>As they climb their final mountain,</i>

<i>Scout and Amber try their best,</i>

<i>but it sure isn't easy.</i>

<i>They're finding themselves
a little on top of each other.</i>

<i>They've made it to the summit.</i>

<i>The coast is now within sight.</i>

<i>It's downhill all the way from here.</i>

<i>The winter snow has melted
down by the Alaskan coast,</i>

<i>and all that green</i>

<i>offers the promise of something to eat.</i>

<i>A quiet meadow.</i>

<i>Time for a little rest.</i>

<i>Amber's certainly taking it easy.</i>

<i>This is one cub
who really likes staying close to mom.</i>

<i>But Scout acts like
he's too old to be carried around.</i>

<i>Bear rides are for babies.</i>

<i>Scout can't believe what he is seeing.</i>

<i>"Other bears?"</i>

<i>"There are other bears in the world?"</i>

<i>"Did everybody know that?"</i>

<i>Sky did.</i>

<i>In fact, her mother brought her to this
meadow when she was little.</i>

<i>And she's been coming here
every summer since.</i>

<i>All these bears have come down
from the mountains.</i>

<i>They're starving.</i>

<i>What they really need is the protein
from loads of salmon.</i>

<i>But this will do in a pinch.</i>

<i>It's like settling for a dirty salad.</i>

<i>Sky and Amber are exhausted
after their long journey.</i>

<i>But Scout, he is a little
too excited to sleep.</i>

<i>This place is crawling with bears!</i>

<i>Scout is looking for a role model.</i>

<i>Which bear will he grow up to be?</i>

<i>He could be an angry bear.</i>

<i>Fighting all the time.</i>

<i>Seems like a lot of work.</i>

<i>No, no, these bears
are way too cuddly.</i>

<i>He definitely wants to be
tougher than this.</i>

<i>Scout's sure he'll find
at least one bear he can look up to.</i>

<i>"Well..."</i>

<i>"Maybe that... Nah."</i>

<i>"Oh, come on."</i>

<i>"Someone do something!"</i>

<i>"Huh? Wow."</i>

<i>"He looks fun at least."</i>

<i>"Just one bear."</i>

<i>"One bear who is the toughest,
coolest bear."</i>

<i>"Anybody? Hello?"</i>

<i>"You, sir..."</i>

<i>"Want to chase me?"</i>

<i>"No. You want to lick a mosquito."</i>

<i>"I thought that being a bear would be,"</i>

<i>"I don't know, more fierce."</i>

<i>"Forget it."</i>

<i>"This is downright embarrassing."</i>

<i>If a tough bear is what Scout wants,</i>

<i>he's about to meet just that.</i>

<i>Magnus.</i>

<i>This bear is huge.</i>

<i>At over 1,000 pounds,</i>

<i>he is three times the size of Sky,</i>

<i>and this meadow is his turf.</i>

<i>He is confident, dominant,</i>

<i>and everyone knows
to stay out of his way.</i>

<i>Sky has to keep her cubs away
from big males like Magnus.</i>

<i>She'll have to find food
somewhere calmer.</i>

<i>As Magnus watches over his domain,</i>

<i>it's clear he's got one thing
in particular on his mind.</i>

<i>Or one she-bear, to be specific.</i>

<i>Magnus might have
a half-ton of weight to throw around,</i>

<i>but he's got no game.</i>

<i>Magnus, you're so obvious.</i>

<i>Put a little mystery into it!</i>

<i>Pick her some flowers
from the meadow or something.</i>

<i>See that walking away? That's sort...</i>

<i>That's bear for "No," I think.</i>

<i>I'm actually starting
to feel sorry for him.</i>

<i>Sky has found a quiet corner
of the meadow</i>

<i>to let her cubs nurse.</i>

<i>Scout and Amber are going
through a growth spurt,</i>

<i>and they need all the milk they can get.</i>

<i>Tikani.</i>

<i>He's a gray wolf,
and the thief of the meadow.</i>

<i>These wolves know a slow bear cub,</i>

<i>makes for a quick, easy meal.</i>

<i>This is why it's so much harder for Sky</i>

<i>than the other bears.</i>

<i>She has to make sure
her cubs are always by her side.</i>

<i>Amber is about to learn what happens,</i>

<i>when you ride a bear
without wearing your seatbelt.</i>

<i>Sky's found herself driven
to a remote, unfamiliar area.</i>

<i>The bad part of town.</i>

<i>The dangers reveal themselves
almost immediately.</i>

<i>This is Chinook.</i>

<i>The outcast.</i>

<i>Banished from the meadow
by Magnus,</i>

<i>Chinook has grown leaner, meaner,</i>

<i>and more desperate for food.</i>

<i>Any food.</i>

<i>Even bear cubs.</i>

<i>There's nowhere to hide.</i>

<i>Sky must stand her ground.</i>

<i>Chinook's circling is dangerous.</i>

<i>If Sky shows any weakness,</i>

<i>he will attack.</i>

<i>It worked.</i>

<i>Sky successfully held her ground.</i>

<i>And Chinook continues
his hunt elsewhere.</i>

<i>Scout and Amber must be
pretty impressed with their mom.</i>

<i>At certain times of the year</i>

<i>a huge change comes over the coast.</i>

<i>A vast area of mudflats are exposed.</i>

<i>This muddy desert
has hidden treasures buried beneath.</i>

<i>Sky and the cubs have gone way out</i>

<i>to the edge of the tide</i>

<i>to search for anything
that could count as calories.</i>

<i>Bears have
an excellent sense of smell.</i>

<i>Their noses are seven times
more sensitive than a bloodhound's.</i>

<i>Scout doesn't seem to get
what Mom's looking for.</i>

<i>Jackpot.</i>

<i>Sky pulls up a meaty clam.</i>

<i>It will help in the meantime,</i>

<i>but one or two clams,</i>

<i>even a dozen, aren't nearly enough.</i>

<i>Sky needs her cubs to stay close.</i>

<i>She's following the low tide
a long way out.</i>

<i>But Scout's not worried.</i>

<i>He'd rather enjoy
his first day at the beach.</i>

<i>Amber chooses to stay close to Mom.</i>

<i>It looks a little less, well, ridiculous.</i>

<i>But Scout doesn't care.</i>

<i>He likes this sand stuff.</i>

<i>"Watch this somersault!"</i>

<i>"Well, it was a half somersault."</i>

<i>"Amber, look at me!
I'm a mud monster!"</i>

<i>"Real mature, Scout. Real mature."</i>

<i>"No, come on! It's fun!"</i>

<i>"Why is this bird
always following us around"</i>

<i>"no matter where we go?"</i>

<i>"I'm gonna go ask him."</i>

<i>"Hey, bird!"</i>

<i>"Hey, where did you get those fish?"</i>

<i>Sky and Amber enjoy
some mother-daughter bonding time.</i>

<i>Scout's learning that sand tastes bad.</i>

<i>Both cubs, in their own way,</i>

<i>are loving their first day at the beach.</i>

<i>But Sky can't afford
too much time playing.</i>

<i>She's got to keep searching
for clams while the tide is out.</i>

<i>Wherever Sky goes, the raven follows.</i>

<i>The raven can spot
an opportunity from way up high,</i>

<i>while the bears got a nose
for finding hidden food.</i>

<i>An unusual partnership, but it works.</i>

<i>"Hey, Mom, how do you open
one of these things, anyway?"</i>

<i>"Mom!"</i>

<i>"Never mind, I got it. I'm fine."</i>

<i>"My claw has... Mom, the..."</i>

<i>"Well, what do you do
if your claw gets stuck in the clam?"</i>

<i>"Let go."</i>

<i>"Mom, it's stuck in my claw!"</i>

<i>"What are you looking at, bird?"</i>

<i>"This is how I carry it."</i>

<i>"Just walk it over here. Just taking
my clam for a walk, that's all."</i>

<i>"Let go of my claw, clam!"</i>

<i>"Let go!"</i>

<i>"I didn't want that clam anyway. "</i>

<i>Sky and the cubs are far from the
shore when the tide starts to turn.</i>

<i>Sky is trying to get
as much food as she can</i>

<i>before the water covers up the mud.</i>

<i>Scout doesn't know
what's about to happen to the tide.</i>

<i>He's just tired from a long day.</i>

<i>And now, they are surrounded
by water.</i>

<i>Freezing cold water.</i>

<i>When Sky finally heads
back to the shore,</i>

<i>she assumes both her cubs
are close behind.</i>

<i>It's a mistake.</i>

<i>Scout is too tired to keep going.</i>

<i>Amber notices that Scout isn't
just dawdling this time.</i>

<i>He's asleep.</i>

<i>When Scout wakes up,</i>

<i>he sees he's stranded
far from the shore.</i>

<i>He desperately calls for his mother.</i>

<i>And she calls back.</i>

<i>Urging him to hurry.</i>

<i>The current is much stronger now,</i>

<i>and Scout is really struggling
to get back on land.</i>

<i>Scout stayed tough
and made it safely to the shore.</i>

<i>And the cubs, well,</i>

<i>they look pretty happy
to see each other.</i>

<i>As the weeks progress,
the weather warms,</i>

<i>and the mudflats are
no longer so exposed.</i>

<i>Time to head back to the meadow,</i>

<i>where it's bursting with color.</i>

<i>Scout and Amber are bonding during
these early days of summer,</i>

<i>while their mother watches
from a safe distance.</i>

<i>With no fish nearby,
it's back to eating grass.</i>

<i>Scout is less than impressed.</i>

<i>By this time of year,
everything tastes a little stale and dry.</i>

<i>With food in such short supply,</i>

<i>even the female bears
are getting a little cranky.</i>

<i>These fierce head-to-heads
may be short,</i>

<i>but they are becoming more frequent.</i>

<i>It's getting tense.</i>

<i>The cubs know something feels wrong.</i>

<i>There's nowhere to hide.</i>

<i>Everyone is watching them.</i>

<i>Seeing her cubs getting nervous,</i>

<i>Sky goes to their side to protect them.</i>

<i>Magnus.</i>

<i>And this time, he's really hungry.</i>

<i>He's spotted the cubs.</i>

<i>Sky must quickly decide what to do.</i>

<i>She runs, hoping to find safety.</i>

<i>It's a choice, she will soon regret.</i>

<i>Chinook!</i>

<i>Round two and ready to fight.</i>

<i>He takes off after them.</i>

<i>Chinook is much stronger than Sky,</i>

<i>but she'll fight with everything she's got</i>

<i>to give her cubs a chance to escape.</i>

<i>The cubs make a run for it.</i>

<i>Sky tries to lead him away,</i>

<i>but instead of following her,</i>

<i>Chinook heads straight for the cubs.</i>

<i>He knows they can't have gotten far.</i>

<i>Chinook's powerful sense of smell</i>

<i>tells him the cubs are hiding
in the logs.</i>

<i>But which ones?</i>

<i>Sky is desperately searching
for her cubs.</i>

<i>Amber.</i>

<i>But no sign of Scout.</i>

<i>Amber doesn't want to leave the
meadow without her brother.</i>

<i>But Sky knows they need
to keep moving.</i>

<i>Chinook could come back
at any moment.</i>

<i>She still has Amber to protect,</i>

<i>no matter how much
she wants to look for Scout.</i>

<i>It's not an easy decision.</i>

<i>There he is!</i>

<i>Back together again.</i>

<i>Sky knows another spot up the coast</i>

<i>her mother took her to long ago.</i>

<i>As she leads her cubs there,</i>

<i>she must be hoping
her luck will start changing.</i>

<i>Midsummer brings
longer days and a new place to feed.</i>

<i>While Sky and the cubs
are moving to a safer place to eat</i>

<i>the rest of the bears leave the
meadow, and head for the shore.</i>

<i>Chinook is already here.</i>

<i>And so is Magnus.</i>

<i>For now, they wait,</i>

<i>and wait.</i>

<i>It's salmon!</i>

<i>The first opportunity to fish.</i>

<i>It has been a full year
since the bears went fishing.</i>

<i>Looks like they're a bit rusty.</i>

<i>"I got it! I got it!"</i>

<i>"I... I had it."</i>

<i>"These are really slippery fish. "</i>

<i>Only Magnus has dignity here.</i>

<i>Magnus doesn't have to fish,</i>

<i>because he has a plan.</i>

<i>He's going to take
whatever Chinook catches.</i>

<i>"Yeah, that's it, Chinook."</i>

<i>"Get me that fish."</i>

<i>"Good bear."</i>

<i>Magnus moves in.</i>

<i>Magnus ultimately wins,</i>

<i>and Chinook can only limp away</i>

<i>watching his hard-earned meal
go to someone else's stomach.</i>

<i>Chinook won't forget this.</i>

<i>Far from the danger
of the crowded salmon beach,</i>

<i>Sky and her cubs are still searching
for a quiet place to feed.</i>

<i>Scout gets distracted
by the tiniest things,</i>

<i>slowing them down.</i>

<i>They're being followed.</i>

<i>Tikani has sensed an opportunity.</i>

<i>If he's quiet enough,</i>

<i>he can snatch a dawdling cub.</i>

<i>Scout attacks!</i>

<i>Tikani wants Scout to follow him.</i>

<i>Get him alone.</i>

<i>But Sky stays close.</i>

<i>Only Sky can chase Tikani off.</i>

<i>This mama bear's keeping
a good eye on her cubs.</i>

<i>Tikani's usual tricks aren't working,</i>

<i>but that doesn't mean he's giving up.</i>

<i>Just a few miles up the coast</i>

<i>Sky follows the raven's call</i>

<i>to a very special place.</i>

<i>A hidden sanctuary</i>

<i>where the bears can
let down their guard.</i>

<i>Nice find, Mr. Raven.</i>

<i>Good eye.</i>

<i>Sky must be worried
about her milk supply.</i>

<i>If she doesn't eat tons of salmon
by the end of the summer,</i>

<i>she won't have enough fat stored up
to feed Scout and Amber</i>

<i>through next winter's hibernation.</i>

<i>The cubs could starve to death
right beside her in the den.</i>

<i>Sky knows that before too long</i>

<i>she will have to brave
the salmon beach.</i>

<i>But first, she has a little treat
to show her cubs.</i>

<i>When the tide goes out,</i>

<i>the ocean becomes
a secret restaurant,</i>

<i>serving up mussel-covered rocks.</i>

<i>It's all-you-can-eat,
but you have to eat carefully.</i>

<i>The cubs seem completely confused.</i>

<i>"Is it supposed to taste like this?"</i>

<i>"This is really crunchy."</i>

<i>But Sky knows that
a good claw-full is worthwhile.</i>

<i>She uses her powerful paws
to expose a hidden snack.</i>

<i>Rock eels.</i>

<i>These shy little fish are
not exactly salmon,</i>

<i>but they're better than nothing.</i>

<i>Scout thinks
he has the muscles for the job.</i>

<i>While Amber lets her mother
do all the heavy lifting.</i>

<i>And the clever raven
collects his reward.</i>

<i>"Hey, that was mine."</i>

<i>"I was saving that!"</i>

<i>It is a lot of work,</i>

<i>but there's nothing else
on the menu right now.</i>

<i>Ouch!</i>

<i>Back at the beach,</i>

<i>the salmon have finally arrived
in large numbers.</i>

<i>This is what the bears
have been waiting for all summer.</i>

<i>The sea is bubbling with fish,</i>

<i>and their massive numbers</i>

<i>make them much easier to catch.</i>

<i>This is where Sky and her cubs
need to be, and soon.</i>

<i>They're already missing out.</i>

<i>Chinook's not letting
anyone swipe a fish from him this time.</i>

<i>Without Magnus around,
he's got more than a mouthful.</i>

<i>Even Tikani is here,
testing out his fishing skills.</i>

<i>It's harder than it looks.</i>

<i>And there's no mistaking
the inexperienced ones out here.</i>

<i>Then it's just a matter
of eating your catch</i>

<i>before someone else does.</i>

<i>Hurry up, little guy!</i>

<i>Run!</i>

<i>You know when a wolf's
walking like that,</i>

<i>he's up to something.</i>

<i>Head down,</i>

<i>slow and steady.</i>

<i>The thief at work.</i>

<i>Impressive.</i>

<i>And he didn't even get his tail wet.</i>

<i>After months of being
on the constant hunt for salmon,</i>

<i>it seems almost impossible
that the bears can be too full to eat.</i>

<i>But that's exactly
what's happening here.</i>

<i>So very full.</i>

<i>And interested in...</i>

<i>I don't know what he's doing.</i>

<i>Suddenly everyone's very itchy.</i>

<i>This guy looks like my dad
when he's watching TV.</i>

<i>"Hey, who changed the channel?"</i>

<i>"I was watching that."</i>

<i>Sky and her cubs aren't
the only ones on a journey here.</i>

<i>The salmon are merely waiting</i>

<i>before they can start heading
upriver to spawn.</i>

<i>They've spent
the entire winter out in the salty ocean,</i>

<i>and it will take
a few weeks for their bodies</i>

<i>to adapt to fresh water.</i>

<i>They hang around the shallow
river mouth behind the beach,</i>

<i>hidden from where
the bears have been hunting.</i>

<i>Sky is the first to get here,</i>

<i>and she's got the place all to herself.</i>

<i>It's a huge amount of fish.</i>

<i>She has to take advantage
of the situation now,</i>

<i>but she knows it's risky
to leave the cubs.</i>

<i>She's only got so much time
before the other bears arrive.</i>

<i>She'll hunt much more efficiently
if she goes it alone.</i>

<i>She decides it's worth the risk.</i>

<i>The cubs try to defend themselves</i>

<i>while calling for their mother's help.</i>

<i>But they can't do it alone.</i>

<i>Sky rushes back, and Tikani retreats.</i>

<i>Sky has taken her cubs
to every spot she knows on the coast</i>

<i>with no luck.</i>

<i>There are other
secret places upstream,</i>

<i>hidden spots like the Golden Pond</i>

<i>that are sometimes filled with fish.</i>

<i>But they're hard to find,
and the climb is steep.</i>

<i>Sky doesn't have much choice,</i>

<i>she needs to find
somewhere to feed before it's too late.</i>

<i>For the salmon,
it's been two weeks in the river mouth,</i>

<i>and they're now used
to the fresh water.</i>

<i>Their journey upstream
can finally begin.</i>

<i>It's an almost unbelievable mission.</i>

<i>They're trying to return to the exact
same place where they were hatched.</i>

<i>They rely on chemical cues,</i>

<i>the taste of the water,
to tell them exactly where to go.</i>

<i>Some travel up to 30 miles upriver</i>

<i>against a relentless current.</i>

<i>And often, the waterfalls are just
too steep to let them pass.</i>

<i>Unable to swim any higher,</i>

<i>these salmon will just have to wait</i>

<i>in the plunge pools below.</i>

<i>This is where the salmon are headed.</i>

<i>Calm, shallow waters that offer
the perfect place to lay their eggs.</i>

<i>Sky and the cubs have just arrived, too.</i>

<i>They've spent the past two weeks</i>

<i>climbing their way to this lonely spot.</i>

<i>Sky is shockingly thin.</i>

<i>She's hoping she's made it
for the salmon's first arrival</i>

<i>to these quiet waters.</i>

<i>But her timing is heartbreakingly off.</i>

<i>The fish are still stuck
in the pools below.</i>

<i>There's nothing to eat.</i>

<i>It looks like this time
the raven was wrong.</i>

<i>They may be soaking wet and freezing,</i>

<i>but the rain actually gives Sky</i>

<i>and the cubs
some much-needed hope.</i>

<i>The downpour causes
the water levels to rise</i>

<i>giving the salmon the exact push
they need to get back on track.</i>

<i>Yes!</i>

<i>They've made it.</i>

<i>Sky knows the salmon are coming.</i>

<i>She can almost taste them.</i>

<i>Sky searches.</i>

<i>Where are they?</i>

<i>It's her first fish of the season.</i>

<i>And the cubs finally get
to taste salmon.</i>

<i>Scout takes his to go.</i>

<i>But Amber Cuddles up
for a little mother-daughter sushi date.</i>

<i>"Mom, salmon is my new favorite food."</i>

<i>"Let's never have mussels again."</i>

<i>The only problem with salmon is</i>

<i>they don't stay in one place for long.</i>

<i>They're still on their journey.</i>

<i>Sky knows where they're headed,</i>

<i>and it's a place far too dangerous</i>

<i>for a mother with young cubs.</i>

<i>With no other options,</i>

<i>she has to find the Golden Pond.</i>

<i>These are the Great Falls.</i>

<i>Only the biggest
and baddest come here.</i>

<i>Thousands of salmon pass
through these falls,</i>

<i>for just a few short weeks
at the end of summer.</i>

<i>If you want to catch a fat fish,</i>

<i>you've got to be in the right place</i>

<i>at the right time.</i>

<i>And even then, well...</i>

<i>...there's no guarantee.</i>

<i>Magnus is an old pro.</i>

<i>Just open your mouth.</i>

<i>The competition for the best
fishing spot is intense.</i>

<i>Chinook wants Magnus' prime position.</i>

<i>But he's forgotten
how powerful Magnus is.</i>

<i>Time for a little reminder.</i>

<i>Chinook surrenders.</i>

<i>And Magnus remains
the undisputed ruler of the Great Falls.</i>

<i>Sky and the cubs have found
a peaceful place</i>

<i>deep in the woods,</i>

<i>upriver from the Great Falls.</i>

<i>Summer is almost over,</i>

<i>and with the promise of fall,</i>

<i>the cubs are already growing
their thick winter coats.</i>

<i>With hardly any salmon,</i>

<i>Sky hasn't had a chance to build up</i>

<i>her fat reserves for the winter.</i>

<i>With no food,</i>

<i>Sky's milk will definitely dry up</i>

<i>and Scout and Amber</i>

<i>won't make it through hibernation.</i>

<i>Poor Sky.</i>

<i>She tried hard all year to be
a good mom and keep her cubs safe.</i>

<i>She's lost and totally exhausted,</i>

<i>but she still doesn't want
to give up the fight.</i>

<i>If only she knew, she's almost there.</i>

<i>Just a short walk away.</i>

<i>This is the Golden Pond,</i>

<i>where Sky wanted to take her cubs.</i>

<i>In certain years, salmon gather here
in unimaginable numbers.</i>

<i>The raven calls, asking Sky to follow.</i>

<i>Sky can hardly believe her eyes.</i>

<i>So many bears, peacefully gathered.</i>

<i>Safe and welcoming.</i>

<i>And more salmon than
she and the cubs can shake a paw at.</i>

<i>With all this salmon,
the cubs will grow fat,</i>

<i>and Sky will be able
to keep them going through the winter.</i>

<i>Sky's long,
difficult journey is finally over.</i>

<i>Turns out that tough bear
Scout was looking for</i>

<i>was right by his side, all along.</i>

<i>As winter approaches,</i>

<i>all the bears begin their trek
back up the mountains.</i>

<i>Scout and Amber will rely
on their mother for the next two years,</i>

<i>growing stronger
with each passing season.</i>

<i>Before the dark days of winter arrive,</i>

<i>every bear must return
to the high peaks</i>

<i>to dig their dens for hibernation.</i>

<i>And for the next six months,</i>

<i>all the bears will remain asleep</i>

<i>under a deep blanket of snow.</i>

<i>There goes Chinook.</i>

<i>He survived another year.</i>

<i>And the mighty Magnus gives
one last look over his domain.</i>

<i>They say the first year
of parenting is the hardest.</i>

<i>But Sky was patient and determined.</i>

<i>She never stopped caring.</i>

<i>And her reward?</i>

<i>Eight little paws following her
back up the mountain</i>

<i>for a long, winter's nap.</i>

Go around. Go around.

Go around.

Hey, bear.

Good. Right there.
