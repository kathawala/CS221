<i>The double ending is okay.
Also, Moonie, watch those breakers.</i>

<i>Very treacherous undertow there.</i>

<i>It's just the
most dramatic thing to come out...</i>

<i>...by the time
you give me another listen.</i>

<i>With all that dynamic
lead guitar playing...</i>

<i>...the drums would make
the best contrast against it.</i>

<i>Being sent to the British Museum.</i>

<i>My resignation, actually.</i>

<i>It's interesting without
being... Picking the word to pieces.</i>

Maybe it's not the right word,
because "irreverence" suggests...

...that you don't give a fuck
about what's already there.

What was interesting is
that I think we all did.

Us, from a...

...middle class
and working class background...

...and our audience being middle and
working class because we were postwar...

...and that that actually meant
that the generation above us...

...had real difficulties engaging with us.

So you'd have terrible trouble
with schoolteachers and stuff.

They would just expect you
to do what they said.

And if you even didn't just...
You know, if you kind of...

It wasn't necessarily you went out
of your way to disobey authority...

...but if you didn't do it in the right
way, they would get angry with you.

So you would end up with,
you know, situations of outright rebellion.

<i>Because the drum... After the silence,
you come in with drums, Moonie, okay?</i>

<i>Cut that, some of it.
Is it all right with you, Pete?</i>

<i>I like your adlib yells and screams,
by the way.</i>

<i>On the second time around,
that would be very effective.</i>

<i>Okay, go.</i>

<i>And this is, like,
'62 or something, '61, '62.</i>

<i>And anyway, I had this sort of, like, um...</i>

<i>...breakdown of some sort, right?</i>

<i>I had, like, a fabulous apartment,
I had a car, you know?</i>

<i>I had this huge sort of career really
moving ahead in the film business...</i>

<i>...and I'm hanging out,
you know, and I'm just dissatisfied.</i>

<i>I didn't really believe
anymore what I was doing.</i>

<i>It became very superficial.</i>

<i>I thought... I was looking
for some sense in myself.</i>

<i>I just hadn't really ever thought
about that before.</i>

<i>And I'm lost, you know?</i>

<i>Anyway, and I'm wandering around
looking, do you know what I mean?</i>

<i>And thinking that, you know,
I need to do something...</i>

<i>...which is more to do with my own
self expression, you know?</i>

And, um...

You know, Kit...
I think a lot about Kit...

...and I miss Kit and, you know,
how we have this sort of thing going on...

It comes and goes. But I'm
basically trying to sort of work out...

...where I am.

<i>I'm reading books that,
like, seem to say things.</i>

<i>Philosophy
and the great novelists and whatever.</i>

I'm seeing these films.
You know, I'm testing...

...you know, my awareness,
my consciousness, right?

I'm listening to jazz.

<i>And I've also now decided
to become a cineaste, right?</i>

<i>I thought you did things...
Like, I became a mod.</i>

<i>You just call yourself that, right? So I'd
gone to see all the films, read all the...</i>

<i>You know, I was voraciously open
to take anything in.</i>

<i>And so I see that the thing
to be in films, right, is a director.</i>

<i>I figured that's the game.</i>

And there's a coffee shop called...

...Act One, Scene 1, right?

<i>That was the name.
It's early in the morning...</i>

...and I go into
the Act One, Scene 1 for a coffee...

...and Kit is sitting in the coffee shop.

So anyway, we meet in this coffee shop,
and it's fantastic to see him...

...and he's very happy to see me,
and we spend the day together.

And at the end of the day...

...we decided that we were gonna
sort of write a screenplay...

...to make a film that would be our film.

<i>I fell in love.</i>

I mean, literally, with both of them
immediately. I mean, I just...

They completely and utterly,
the pair of them, totally changed my life.

That was good. Can I have a look?

<i>However highbrow you want to make
it, I still think there is more valid...</i>

...new creative music
being made at the pop end.

I don't see any good classical composers
emerging at the moment.

I certainly haven't heard
a decent new symphony...

...or a decent new opera
in the last 18 months...

...and I think opera as we know now
is absolutely defunct.

One needs a completely fresh approach
and I think pop's gonna provide it.

You gotta talk to Chris about this. It's a
pity that Kit isn't here to tell his side.

But, you know, how did these two guys
find each other, you know?

I mean, for a while there...

...I thought they must have fallen in love
and had an affair or something.

<i>I couldn't work out
where they'd come together.</i>

<i>I knew they'd worked on films together,
and they loved that about each other...</i>

<i>...that Chris did one thing, Kit did
another. We'd come up with dumb reasons.</i>

Like, you know,
maybe they were lovers...

...or something, but that just made it more
intriguing, you know. More interesting.

<i>This memory came up
that I was being carried.</i>

<i>I think I was being carried
by my Aunt Maude, ahem...</i>

<i>...and my mother, and I guess my brother.
And we went into what was called...</i>

<i>...an Anderson air-raid shelter.</i>

<i>You know, I played, as a kid on,
you know... In the bomb sites.</i>

<i>That's what we did.</i>

<i>We played in the bomb sites,
in the half bombed-out houses.</i>

<i>We liked to smoke and, you know,
do those very young things.</i>

<i>So life was very quick.</i>

<i>You were very sort of, like, old
in a sense, quite quickly.</i>

<i>We were really different individuals.</i>

<i>Chris, he was always like
a big persona.</i>

<i>You know, he was this rough,
tough, fighting, sort of spiv.</i>

<i>I missed most of his kind of gang years,
you know, because I'd left home.</i>

<i>And then I remember getting a call...</i>

<i>...and having a conversation with
my mother because she was frightened.</i>

<i>I think police had brought him home.</i>

And so I was aware that I had to bridge
a lot of water that had come between us.

And the initial thing
was just getting him to admit...

...or getting him to acknowledge
that he did have an interest.

In my conversation with him,
there was this kind of lethargy...

...like he just wasn't interested
in anything.

<i>I had found something.</i>

<i>Unbeknownst to him and the family...</i>

...I had found this thing
to be an actor, and then, finally...

...he confessed that...

When I, you know, pressed him...

...he said he was interested in girls.

That's what he was interested in, girls.

And so I said, "What kind of girls?"

"Well, you know...

...dancing girls." And that came to me...

...the ballet, because I thought,
"God, if you're interested in chicks...

...working backstage at the ballet...

...is the place where a young East End
hobbidy wants to be, you know?"

<i>And I knew from my experiences
that most of those girls were just dying...</i>

<i>...for somebody like Chris
to fall across their path, you know.</i>

And if you worked backstage
in the ballet...

...they're there and they'll love you.
You know, you just gotta be there.

<i>And I stand on the side of the stage...</i>

<i>...looking for all these
amazing women.</i>

<i>And then the orchestra starts to tune up
and I hear this music.</i>

<i>And then the lights come on
and then the show begins, and then...</i>

<i>...these people are just dancing...</i>

<i>...and it's the lights, you know,
and it's so, like, gigantic to me.</i>

The show is about another half hour to go
and this old prop guy comes up to me.

"And so you haven't got any more cues.
You can go home now."

I said, "No, no, no! I'm not leaving."

And that night, I mean,
I absolutely know that whatever this was...

...um, I wanted in.

<i>I'm now, like, a second A.D.
or second assistant, right?</i>

<i>And Kit, he's in the same position
as I am...</i>

<i>...and in the studio we bump into
each other, as you do, right...</i>

<i>...when you're a runner, an A.D.</i>

<i>We used to go to the cafeteria
together at lunchtime...</i>

<i>...and we discovered
we had exactly the same...</i>

I had the same as him,
in terms of French cinema...

...you know, certain types of films
that we liked.

<i>So that began the relationship.</i>

<i>He said he'd met this guy,
he was very smart, and different to him...</i>

...but they kind of were
a very good duo.

They complemented each other,
like two and two made six.

And that they'd had this idea where
they could never really make that jump...

...from being film assistants
to being film directors.

You know, it was impossible.

Their idea was that they would find
a rock 'n' roll group.

They would find a really good
rock 'n' roll group...

...and they would manage them.

And they would make them
so successful...

...that they would be able
to direct a film about them.

And then that film
would be their showpiece.

That film would be their entrée...

...into the world of film directing.
And he did tell me about the idea...

...and before they met The Who, or
The High Numbers as they were called.

<i>Kit, he'd been in the army,
he'd gone to Oxford...</i>

<i>...and he'd also then gone from Oxford
to some cinema school in Paris, right?</i>

<i>All of that stuff that I thought was
fantastic because none of that...</i>

<i>...was even in my viewpoint. We didn't
know that you could go to college...</i>

<i>...where I came from. We weren't told.
Then the fourth thing I knew about Kit...</i>

...was that he had gone to Brazil...

...with an explorer to film...

...and he was actually...

So, he was, like,
a guy who'd held a camera, right?

<i>He's gone to Brazil
because it was a chance to film...</i>

<i>...and because he was a reckless,
impulsive, sort of great guy, right?</i>

<i>The Iriri River was the longest river...</i>

<i>...in the world
that had never been descended in full.</i>

You could go about a thousand kilometers
in any direction and meet nobody.

Just as though it was an island
out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

<i>Kit wanted to come.
I even thought it was great...</i>

...because he was thinking
of making a career in filmmaking.

<i>And he came along
as the cameraman.</i>

He was very tough
and, um, uncomplaining.

Because it became quite
a tough expedition.

Much, much harder than we realized
it was going to be.

<i>Kit had incredible, um, courage.</i>

<i>You know, he had incredible...</i>

<i>He was really always able
to sort of really take risks.</i>

<i>He'd gone to Brazil with
this explorer, this guy called Richard.</i>

And, um, the guy he was with,
they'd gone into an unknown part...

...he got killed by a tribe.

<i>I remember him coming back saying:</i>

<i>"I've just had a radio message that
there's been an attack on your camp."</i>

<i>And, at that time, he said,
"I think five people have been killed."</i>

<i>In fact, it was only one,
and it was an ambush on the trail.</i>

<i>And in a way, I'm incredibly
sort of, you know, in wonder.</i>

<i>It was the possibility that you could do,
you know... It was widening my angle...</i>

<i>...of awareness on possibilities.</i>

Mr. Lambert, Mr. Mason
was an experienced explorer...

...and other members of the party have a
lot of experience of this kind of country.

What went wrong on this expedition?

Well, the verdict of the Brazilian
authorities was that it was:

Pure fate.

<i>We end up living together, right?</i>

So we're in the same apartment,
and then...

...we start to try and write screenplays,
right? We started coming up with ideas.

<i>And then we got round to sort of
what we really both liked.</i>

<i>We got round to this whole
sort of Jean-Luc Godard...</i>

<i>...cinema verité type of thing...</i>

<i>...and we realized that that's
really where we should go.</i>

That's when I came up with the idea
of the rock 'n' roll thing.

We could manage a group,
and how we did it...

...would be the theme of the film.
How we managed them.

<i>We'd shoot it all
as we were doing it...</i>

<i>...and that we would film
the whole process of the managing...</i>

<i>...and the idea of, like, finding
the group, working with them...</i>

<i>...making records,
becoming successful...</i>

<i>...would be filmed,
the whole process on all levels.</i>

<i>Kit and I, we looked everywhere. We
looked all over the place for these bands.</i>

<i>How we defined what group we wanted
to put in our so-called movie...</i>

<i>...was we didn't know
what we wanted...</i>

<i>...but we absolutely knew
what we didn't want.</i>

<i>I mean, we looked for months.</i>

We found the people who were doing
the music to be smart and neat and...

They were very,
like, jumping up and down.

You know,
they weren't what we wanted.

<i>But this we wanted
was really about us.</i>

<i>But it was gonna be some
mad fucking concoction of stuff...</i>

<i>...that looked like Lambert and Stamp.</i>

<i>What we did with
the Railway Hotel, the Railway Club...</i>

<i>...it was a sort of a institutional pub
kind of place.</i>

<i>It was a bit sordid and grotty
like they all are.</i>

<i>So we blacked out all the windows,
we turned all the radiators up...</i>

<i>...and we took all the light bulbs out
and put in pink or red ones.</i>

<i>So it was dark. It was hot.</i>

<i>The band were loud.
We had too many people in.</i>

<i>It was fantastic. It was a real success.</i>

Things were going well,
and one day I'm there on the door...

...and The High Numbers are playing.
I think someone came and said:

"There's some straight guy
poking around outside."

Now, we used to have in the club

<i>We were officially only allowed 180,
but I suddenly thought:</i>

"Christ, it might be the local council."
It was trouble.

This was Kit Lambert.
I mean, I didn't know.

<i>He's been driving around and he's seen
this line of scooters and mods, you know.</i>

<i>He'd been looking for a band
to put into a film.</i>

<i>Been looking for months
with his partner.</i>

<i>And the first thing he said to me:
"Is it always like this?"</i>

I said, "No, no, it's a special night."
Or something like that.

Anyway, he forced his way
past me, I think...

...and looked inside
and he looked really shaken.

And, you know, he's...
And I'm going, I thought:

<i>"This is it." And he said,
"I'm looking to hire a band."</i>

<i>And I thought,
We went in, we watched the band a bit...</i>

<i>...then we went upstairs to talk.</i>

Lambert says later, when he went,
he said it was like going into hell...

<i>...or a version of Hades or something.
He said it was pitch black...</i>

...very loud.
The band were doing feedback.

Pete was just getting into
his feedback stuff.

And he said all these mods
were doing these dances...

<i>...and he said
they looked mesmerized...</i>

<i>...and just what he wanted.</i>

<i>Up his street.</i>

<i>Yeah, I do remember him.
I remember the night that he was there.</i>

<i>I remember Barney coming
and saying to me, after the show...</i>

...that there was somebody
that had seen the band...

...that was interested
in making a film about us.

<i>They were just
an extraordinary flash of...</i>

<i>I just felt a sense of serenity
about them, of calmness.</i>

Of Kit smoking...

...and not really addressing
the band very much. Kit didn't...

...immediately engage with the band.

He seemed to be like somebody
who had a big idea and was...

<i>I felt like we were actors in his play.</i>

There were two guys here,
assistant directors in the film business.

They were prepared to give all that up
and manage the band.

And put some money into it.
I think they lied about the money.

It was an interesting time.
I was at art school.

<i>The other guys were in day jobs.</i>

<i>Our group, The High Numbers,
we hadn't really...</i>

<i>We hadn't really got our heads
sorted out properly.</i>

<i>We were still struggling
to find an image...</i>

<i>...and find our feet and...</i>

We wouldn't have been
particularly impressive. Um...

We had a few gimmicks. You know, Keith
had an extraordinary look about him.

In fact, you can see the movie
of the event.

<i>They shot the first film
of the band at that gig...</i>

<i>...and took us over then.
Their original intention, you know...</i>

...was to make a movie,
not to manage a band.

But they ended up doing both.

<i>♪ Ooh poo pah do ♪</i>

<i>♪ Well, baby, call me the most ♪♪</i>

<i>I think they got to know the band...</i>

<i>...got to see it,
and got to see the situation...</i>

...and saw the potential.

<i>They saw, probably, that the band really
didn't have any leadership at that time.</i>

<i>And I walked through with Kit...</i>

<i>...towards the front of the stage.
I'm sort of fascinated, you know.</i>

<i>I'm picking up what their audience...
This is their audience, right?</i>

<i>And the atmosphere was just rich.</i>

<i>You know, you could really feel
an audience, an atmosphere here...</i>

<i>...although the show is over.</i>

I look at these guys. They're four, like...

<i>You know, they're four complicated,
difficult fucking guys, right?</i>

I can see that, you know?
They're really awkward. Heh.

And I'm thinking, "Yeah."
You know?

And I just, like...
You know, I got that, right?

<i>Chris had got this job...</i>

<i>...as a second assistant...</i>

<i>...on a film called</i>
The Heroes of Telemark.

<i>And he was going to location...</i>

<i>...a long location shoot in Norway.</i>

And he told me that he had been able
to sign this group...

...who they'd rechristened The Who...

<i>...and they'd been able to sign them...</i>

<i>...because they'd offered them

<i>...and he was going to go
on location to Norway...</i>

<i>...and he was just gonna live
on the canteen food.</i>

<i>And he'd arranged for his salary
to be sent back to London...</i>

<i>...and that 80 pounds was gonna be

<i>...for the four members of The Who.</i>

And I thought that was kind of...

...a landmark, you know?
I thought that was, like, really smart.

<i>So then Kit and I went to their
parents, and the parents loved this...</i>

...because Kit could put on a white shirt,
and he was... He'd been to Oxford.

But we went to the parents...

...and we agreed in the contract
to give them a salary.

- Which the parents loved.
- Right, so...

A guaranteed salary.

I mean, where's this salary
gonna come from?

Well, we wanted to, you know...
We were gonna find it, right?

He was excited about it.
They were kind of potential.

<i>And I said,
"Are they kind of great-looking?</i>

<i>Are they like the Beatles?"
And he said, "Well, not exactly."</i>

He thought they had a look.

So he gets out this photograph
and he shows it to us.

<i>Our hearts sink, and we said:</i>

"Chris, they're so ugly. They're the
ugliest guys. They're not gonna make it.

There's no way
these guys are gonna make it."

- That's right.
- And we picked out which one...

We thought Keith Moon was okay.

- We thought he was cute.
- We thought Roger was okay.

And Chris said,
"That's the one the girls like."

And then... But we said,
"But the other guy with the nose...

- That's right.
- ...it's just not gonna work."

<i>♪ When you move in
Right up close to me ♪</i>

- Do you think we could have...
- Yes.

- ...a conversation with you?
- Yes, yes.

<i>♪ That's when I get the shakes ♪</i>

<i>♪ All over me ♪</i>

<i>♪ Quivers down my backbone ♪♪</i>

<i>It was about putting the ideas
up, seeing what they looked like...</i>

<i>...and trying them out.</i>

<i>We had no idea of what they did
in the music business...</i>

<i>...or what this whole world was about.</i>

We didn't come to the group
as, like, professional managers.

We came with these two guys
who had these ideas...

...and were filmmakers
and wanted to manage.

We never said we knew how to do it.

So we came in
and like, "Hey, forget it, right?

We're gonna do this and that."
They loved that.

They loved us. They... Every idea we
threw at them, you know, they loved us.

- Why?
- I have no idea.

I mean, we... You know, I mean,
Kit was funny.

I was, like, hip. We had a lot of dialogue.
You know, we'd been around the block.

They were sort of like a year younger
than us and, you know, we were like...

Whatever it was.
They thought we were great.

And we were telling them these ideas
about filming and this.

You know,
we were really selling the deal.

And they thought it was fabulous,
and so they all went along with it.

- Um, then I...
- Did you have any idea...

- ...what the fuck you were talking about?
- No.

No, but, I mean, I knew that what
we would do would be fascinating, right?

I told them, you know, we're gonna
film stuff, you know, we're here.

You know, we gotta sort of... I mean, and
I started to sprout off like, you know:

"We're gonna break the fucking iron
stranglehold of the opium of the masses."

I was giving them sort of Trotsky rhetoric
and, you know... Whatever, right?

- They fucking bought all this?
- Yeah.

Well, I don't know if they bought it.

I mean, they thought, "These guys
are fucking out there," right?

We often used to say this will be 18
months to two years, and then it's over.

Nobody believed, you see...

...that that period of pop music
would last very long anyway.

So if you... What I had was this idea
that it would deliberately...

...blow itself up.

You know, which Kit and Chris
were really quite keen on...

...you know, as an idea.

They didn't know
what hit them about ideas.

"We're gonna film everything. We're
gonna sort of create images for you."

You know:

- Like what kind of images?
- Who the fuck knows?

I mean, look, I'm like...
I'm gasping for breath.

I mean, I'm doing the usual
sort of, like, you know, mirrors work.

Balls in the air.

But I had, underneath all this,
you see, I had...

...you know, the purpose, the meaning.

Kit and I, relationship, all those things.

There was an undercurrent
in our personalities that was real.

<i>And I think a lot of it
was the chemistry of the two.</i>

<i>It was the most unlikely partnership,
Lambert and Stamp, you could imagine.</i>

<i>I mean, first of all,
Kit Lambert was very upper class...</i>

<i>...and had this upper-class accent.</i>

It must have been very strange growing up
with that famous father, Constant Lambert.

<i>And all that involvement with all
those sort of aristocratic celebs...</i>

<i>...and highbrow intellectual
musical people.</i>

So, what we are setting out to do is to
assemble a portrait of Constant Lambert...

...viewed through those
who knew him best.

<i>Our search begins in a club
in Wardour Street...</i>

<i>...where a Lambert is still
involved in the making of music.</i>

<i>How does Christopher Lambert, manager
of a pop group, remember his father?</i>

<i>Well, sort of kind, but perhaps
a rather formidable figure in many ways.</i>

Strongly eccentric. I'd say that.

I remember noticing that, children are
very conscious of these things, I suppose.

He would be completely occupied
by his own thoughts...

...and therefore not terribly aware of
sometimes what was going on around him.

I suppose he's the only person alive
to have been driving with somebody...

...who then found themselves
unable to change gear...

...because they couldn't find
the gear lever.

My father had managed
to get it up the leg of his trousers...

...while doing the <i>Times</i> crossword puzzle
on his knee. He was that kind of person.

He didn't talk much about his father.

He... I came into his room at Oxford
in his first year.

<i>And I find him in tears and I said,
"Kit, what's the matter?"</i>

And he said, "I'm just very depressed.
I've been thinking about my father."

And I didn't take it any further.

I let him talk a bit more.

He didn't say anything
particularly revealing.

<i>I remembered that his father
died about three years before.</i>

And also he was gay
and he must have gone through...

...incredible gay period
at public school.

<i>In those days, you see,
I think it was illegal to be gay...</i>

<i>...and they were very open
to blackmail and stuff like this.</i>

<i>And he'd gone to Lancing Public School
which is a private school...</i>

<i>...and he'd been an officer in the army.</i>

<i>He came from this
Oxford-educated theatrical environment...</i>

<i>...that he'd been to all these schools
that we could only dream about.</i>

<i>Kit wouldn't say he was the first
real posh guy I'd ever spoke to...</i>

<i>...but Kit was the only posh guy
I'd ever spoken to...</i>

<i>...that was actually interested in me...</i>

...and wasn't
talking down to me and...

His enthusiasm was inst...
I mean, it was...

You could cut it with a knife.
I mean, it was... It was...

It was out here on him
when he came to you.

It was so warm
and he was just, "Fucking great!"

Well, not very short.

- Up to here?
- Pretty short. No, no, no!

- Why not?
- Further down there, about that far.

- Quarter inch above my eyes like that.
- Quarter.

Not straight, of course. No?

Why's that?

It's all the worry I do.

<i>It took quite a bit of time
to get to know Chris...</i>

...because he was always off
earning the money...

...to pay our wages.

<i>Earning the money for the guitars
that we were smashing basically.</i>

<i>This was the Ace Face.</i>

We were never gonna...
Or I was never gonna be that.

<i>I loved the fact
that he did not give a fuck.</i>

<i>He... You know,
he would not stand on grace.</i>

<i>You know, he wasn't frightened
of authority.</i>

He did not give a monkey's toss
for breaking the rules...

...if the rules were stupid.

<i>Chris Stamp was working-class
in the East End.</i>

<i>His father was a tugboat captain
on the Thames or something like that.</i>

<i>You know, something...
I mean, talk about chalk and cheese.</i>

And it's almost like... You can imagine if
you'd made this up and gone as a...

You know, a sitcom comedy idea, say look,
you've got this upper-class guy...

...whose father is a classical composer.
You got this tugboat captain's son.

You know, working-class...
They get toge... And you go, "No way."

You know what I mean? It wouldn't work.
It... You know, it's too far-fetched.

<i>When Kit and I first agreed
to sort of make the film together...</i>

<i>...we were actually
sharing an apartment.</i>

On the... On the table.

Will anyone listen to me?

Will anyone listen to me?

<i>One of the things that Kit and I
did talk about was class.</i>

<i>The rock thing was moving
in a defiant way...</i>

<i>...in the class system.</i>

<i>Very loud, Keith, now!</i>

<i>We both considered ourselves,
in a sense, outside of class, but of class.</i>

<i>We were incomplete...</i>

<i>...and we both knew that it wasn't like...</i>

<i>...I would sort of have
an inner satisfaction by becoming...</i>

<i>...rich and upper-class, and he knew
that he wouldn't have inner satisfaction...</i>

<i>...by becoming hip and working-class.</i>

<i>But we thought that
there was somewhere within this...</i>

<i>...that would make life
a little bit more...</i>

<i>...you know, like, real-feeling.</i>

<i>You know, like, really feelings,
like, more authentic or something.</i>

<i>And in a lot of ways,
I mean, Kit was the first...</i>

<i>...you know, really meaningful relationship
that I'd ever entered into.</i>

<i>Kit was a man,
but he was a gay man...</i>

<i>...so he had the sort of sensitivity
that I wanted to sort of communicate with.</i>

<i>And I think
that there was a certain safety...</i>

<i>- ...in this relationship with Kit.</i>
- You've got to be Chris Stamp.

- You've got to be Chris Stamp.
- The living image.

<i>I wasn't able to communicate
emotionally with a woman, right?</i>

<i>I was naive in that area.</i>

<i>I didn't know how to get into
an emotional relationship with a woman.</i>

<i>So Kit gave me that safety
of being able to go there...</i>

<i>...because it was out in the open,
it was understood.</i>

<i>And as I say for me,
it allowed me, in a sense, to be...</i>

<i>...more risk-taking
emotionally than I had been.</i>

<i>We were both marginalized
sort of, you know...</i>

...me in my class
and him in his gayness.

<i>And he obviously had
some sort of love for me.</i>

<i>So I sort of trusted that.</i>

<i>I'd never risked relationship before...</i>

<i>...and the acceptance on my part,
which was quite a profound acceptance.</i>

<i>You know, my young, stud,
hip image...</i>

<i>...was rallying against
this acceptance of Kit.</i>

<i>What that worked into was the ESP
that we had as a creative force.</i>

<i>So it was a very powerful bond.</i>

<i>Not really quite defined...</i>

<i>...because it was really defined outwardly
in a creative sense with The Who.</i>

Believe me, my mind wasn't that fucking
sophisticated then. But I knew something.

There was this vast impact of teenagers
unifying into this big mass...

...which people call mods.

<i>In marketing,
you're always trying to find...</i>

...some way to get around the fact
that the audience are a problem.

The consumer is a problem.

Well, the way that you stop
the consumer being a problem...

...is you don't give them
what they want.

You allow them to be.

<i>You affirm who they are.</i>

<i>You don't try to change them.</i>

<i>Kit and Chris, they could see...</i>

<i>If I could just give you a picture, there
you are, you're on the stage with a guitar.</i>

And the week before,
from the stage, you would see...

I'll often tell this story. You would see,
you know, the sharp guy.

Bill, the sharp guy.

I love that. Love that. That shirt.

Love those. That jacket.

You go out, you buy yourself a jacket
and shirt like Bill.

Next week, you're on the stage.

Bill, meanwhile, hasn't realized
how cool he looks...

...and is coming in his Dungarees
and his, you know, sweatshirt.

You're on the stage
with Bill's outfit from last week.

Bill then looks at you
and thinks, "Hey."

So he comes back with the shirt and
the jacket but everybody thinks it's you...

<i>...that's influenced Bill,
not the other way around.</i>

<i>So you become
a mirror to the audience.</i>

<i>Kit and Chris watched this happen...</i>

<i>...and started to develop it as a way...</i>

<i>...of harnessing the energy
of the audience...</i>

<i>...which was to empower them, make
them realize how important they were.</i>

I was really uncomfortable with it.
Really uncomfortable.

You know, when we did
our Marquee residency...

<i>...Mike Shaw ran all around London
giving people tickets...</i>

<i>...and he was choosing
sharp-looking people.</i>

<i>So we'd go to play the Marquee...</i>

...and the fucking whole audience is full
of all these unbelievably sharp-dressers.

<i>We had this idea which became
known as the Hundred Faces Club.</i>

<i>We would pick one of these kids...</i>

<i>...and make them official members.
We would tell them they'd get in free...</i>

<i>...and they knew that they were in
this sort of unique thing.</i>

They were able to recognize that synergy
that was going on between the audience.

And the only reason that I was into that,
spotting that, was because, again...

...because of art-school training.
Being told by my teachers, find a patron.

Go out there, find a patron.
Find somebody who will pay you to do art.

And I very, very quickly
realized, you know...

...the point where I was gonna go,
"Enough of this stupid band...

<i>...and of this stupid industry."</i>

<i>Just as I'm looking at my watch...</i>

...in the end, I suddenly think,
"This is my patron. The audience."

Well, Kit and Chris took it further.

They're not just the patrons.

They're the essence.

And they are the people.
You don't market to them.

You market them.

<i>And we never quite knew
what made them a Face.</i>

<i>They had to dance well.</i>

<i>They had to dress weird or well,
in some way showed...</i>

<i>...their rebelliousness,
their individuality.</i>

<i>So we weren't only trying to identify
The Who as such...</i>

<i>...but their specific audience
through our judgment.</i>

<i>We were the guys saying, "This is what
we think The Who audience is."</i>

<i>And we made them
a Hundred Faces member.</i>

<i>- And one of those was Irish Jack.
- I remember like it was yesterday.</i>

<i>He was older than me
and didn't look like a real mod.</i>

<i>As I stood there, I kept looking
at this guy, Kit Lambert.</i>

<i>I couldn't believe Lambert was going to be
the new manager of The High Numbers.</i>

<i>He looked timid
and had a small physique...</i>

<i>...like it had never properly grown
to his full proportions.</i>

<i>He had a scarf
folded over his shoulder...</i>

<i>...and wore a blazer-type
double-breasted jacket.</i>

<i>I shook his hand,
and when he said, "Kit Lambert"...</i>

<i>...he sounded like someone
from the BBC.</i>

<i>He reminded me of an Oxford don...</i>

<i>...and the accent, ridiculous as it was,
suited him down to the ground.</i>

<i>I found myself liking him instantly...</i>

<i>...and I remember being very impressed
when he told me his business partner...</i>

<i>...Chris Stamp,
was currently in Ireland...</i>

<i>...working as an assistant director
on the film</i> Young Cassidy.

Standing next to Kit Lambert,
I felt a rush of excitement...

<i>...as I listened to
his rich Oxford tones...</i>

<i>...while he preached a gospel about The
High Numbers needing a new direction.</i>

<i>I felt Lambert studying me as he dragged
the tar from a small French cigarette.</i>

<i>In the background, 500 mods
stomped in their red nylon socks...</i>

<i>...desert boots
and pink stay-pressed jeans...</i>

...to the Nashville Teens'
"Tobacco Road."

"Which do you think is best?"

Kit Lambert shouted to me
over the din.

"The High Numbers or The Who?"

It was that good, and I hadn't
even met Chris Stamp yet.

Kit thought that The High Numbers
sounded like bingo.

He thought people would think it was
bingo when he was giving out leaflets.

<i>He didn't realize that, for mods,
it meant the numbers were kind of kids...</i>

<i>...and a high number was some
kind of top mod, I suppose.</i>

First, we were gonna change their name.
They'd used the name "The Who" before.

I was back at the flat, and they...

They were in the van,
trying to think of a name.

And they didn't come into the flat
because at the time...

...Pete and I were dope heads.
We were smoking dope at art school.

The others looked down upon it.
Didn't approve.

They were very straight then.
Roger was a factory worker.

John worked in the tax office.

<i>And they thought we were lazy,
no-good, art students.</i>

<i>We were, actually,
but we resented them knowing it.</i>

Anyway, Pete said, "Let's go in
and see if Barney's got any ideas."

So they did come into the flat. It was only
the second time they'd ever been in there.

We made coffee and sit around.
Just coming up with these names.

And I sort of thought, "Imagine what
you'd do if it was The Who"?

<i>You know you'd say, "The Who!" "Who?"
"The Who." You know, corny but it was...</i>

<i>He'd milk it for all it was worth.</i>

<i>There were various other names.
"Nothing" was a great name.</i>

<i>Fantastic sort of name.</i>

<i>At one time, I wanted to call it
"British European Airways"...</i>

<i>...because I'd seen it... But I was
so stoned by then, they ignored me.</i>

And the other name in contention was
"The Hair," which was also a good name.

Then Pete came up
with the idea of saying:

"Let's call it 'The Hair and The Who.'"

"That sounds like a pub."

It was a terrible name. Absolutely awful.

<i>And we left it like that, and then
what happened the next day...</i>

<i>...when Roger came around
to pick us up, he just said:</i>

"It's 'The Who, ' isn't it?" So that
was it. Anyway, "The Who" worked.

First of all, it looked good on posters.
It was massive.

We wanted to use that name
because we wanted it to be a name...

<i>...anything could be written on.</i>

Then he thought it wasn't long enough.

I thought he got rid of The High Numbers
because it was long.

He said, "It's not long enough.
We gotta have a longer name."

Then he came up with a masterstroke
where he called it:

<i>"The Who, Maximum R&B."</i>

They had this on these black-and-white
posters that were made for the Marquee...

...with Pete swinging his arm, and that's
when they came up with this logo...

<i>...with The Who with
an arrow symbol for a male...</i>

...and with the arrow coming out the O,
which people think I came up with.

People say, "You designed that."
I say, "I wish I had. I didn't."

<i>I thought it was great,
to turn it back to The Who.</i>

<i>Which was fantastic,
because I thought of it.</i>

<i>We're trying to define,
you know, what their image is.</i>

And also, we were very constricted.
We had no money.

We had no money at all.

So we were trying to be as clever
with bank managers giving us loans...

...and running up sort of enormous debt
with tailors and winemakers.

Whatever it was, right?
We were trying to do all these things...

How did you plan
to back any of this up?

How did you plan to back this up?
Pay for it?

Well, we thought... We just had absolute
belief in ourselves, right? Heh.

- Where's Pete, Kit?
- I have absolutely no idea.

- We're gonna find him.
- He rang off.

<i>There were not probably
two guys on the planet...</i>

...that knew less about rock
than these two, but you felt...

...the... And they had no connections.

Little doctor
in Wimpole Street called Artemis.

Has it to do with venereal disease,
do you know?

No, no, no.

This fella called...

This fella Chris Stamp
introduced me to him.

<i>First of all, we wanted to find out
if they did any songwriting.</i>

And Pete said,
"Well, I've written one song."

And we said that will do.

<i>If you can write one, right?</i>

Kit soon saw in that band that, really, the
two stars in it were Pete and Keith Moon.

They were the two,
and he nurtured those two...

<i>...quite clumsily,
at the expense of the others.</i>

<i>And Roger, for one, I think resented it,
quite rightly because he got a bad deal.</i>

<i>It was Roger's band.
He was the leader.</i>

<i>So, what happened when
the music thing started with Pete...</i>

...something came out of Kit
that was always there.

Right.

But he hadn't owned that.

- That was very good.
<i>- Suddenly, he could talk to Pete...</i>

<i>...about song construction...</i>

- It's the quiet bit...
<i>- ...and just those ideas.</i>

<i>So he brought to this relationship
with Pete...</i>

<i>...the newness of his acceptance
of his musical heritage...</i>

<i>...and the beginning
of Pete's understanding...</i>

<i>...that he was able to be
a musician and a composer.</i>

<i>Pete just suddenly became like a really
fabulous fucking writer, you know?</i>

<i>They were our managers.</i>

<i>Then things really started to change.</i>

Their ideas were fantastic,
and that's all I cared about was this band.

<i>All I ever wanted to do was
make this band successful.</i>

<i>And they, literally,
had a map of England.</i>

And they would stick... "Gonna play there,
gonna play there, gonna play there.

<i>And we're gonna get these posters,
and gonna do that, gonna do that."</i>

<i>Just like planning a battle.</i>

<i>It was just... It was like being
caught in a whirlwind of ideas of...</i>

<i>...how to get noticed.</i>

<i>♪ Took me three years of sweating blood
To clean off all that Tennessee mud ♪♪</i>

<i>For that period, The Who was the...</i>

<i>...Kit Lambert, stroke,
Pete Townshend Who.</i>

<i>I know Roger probably wouldn't like that,
but there's definitely...</i>

<i>The Who went in this direction
of writing this...</i>

<i>Having Pete Townshend's songs.</i>

<i>And very much inspired
by Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.</i>

Kit started nurturing him and taking him
and Keith to posh restaurants...

...and introducing them to French wine
and so on, and all the rest of it.

And this is where Keith
developed this "dear boy" thing.

"Dear boy." He got it from Kit.

I have to be honest about this. I do feel
that I was treated differently by them...

...to the other guys in the band.

I felt valued, you know?

I was the one that was taken
and moved from their apartment...

...to a flat in Belgravia, you know? Um...

Keith Moon was left to, you know...

...struggle out in Wembley,
where he came from.

Kit came once
to have a photograph.

I was having my photograph taken
for a teen magazine...

...at the apartment I shared with Barney,
and he went around, looked around...

...and immediately said,
"You've gotta get out of here."

<i>He knew Pete was the one that
would write the songs, he needed to...</i>

...kind of become his muse or whatever
and encourage him.

Pete and I were living together,
and Pete said:

"Kit wants me to go
and move into his place."

I said, "All right." And he moved away.

Why did they move you in with them?

What was the...?

I think the, um...

They felt... I mean, you know...
You really have to ask Chris.

<i>But I... The message
that I got that I felt...</i>

...was it was nurturance, and in a sense,
trying to draw me away...

...from the art-school crowd.

He'd come to our flat,
it was just blues records...

...dark, red light bulbs, smoking dope...

...people hanging about, you know?
He didn't like it. Well, I don't know...

And Pete said, "What he wants is,
he wants to take me away...

...from the squalor that is ours
to the squalor that is his.

His upper-class,
posh Belgravia squalor."

<i>We moved from one apartment
to another apartment, Kit and I.</i>

<i>So we wanted an apartment that would
have a lot of good credit rating.</i>

We had absolutely no money.

We wanted to move to an area of London
where you could get things delivered.

They'd deliver stuff with credit
because of where you lived.

<i>Kit would be teaching us
how to get by with no money.</i>

Which, you know, the aristocracy,
they're educated in it.

I mean, they're, you know,
absolutely expert at it.

You know,
I've had an account at...

...Stone's Wine Shop in Belgravia...

...since I was 20.

They've never sent me a bill.

Whenever I go there
and buy wine, if I need any...

I don't drink wine anymore...
But if I need wine for a party.

They say, "Should we put it on account?"
I say, "Do you want me to pay this?"

"Don't worry, sir."

It still goes on.
So I think there was that.

That sense of arriving in this place.

And Kit was very, very
transparent about it.

He said, "You know, we need
to have an address in Eaton Place...

...because then we won't ever
have to pay our bills."

I was living in the back of the van...

...but now I got a girlfriend.
She didn't quite like the back of the van.

Heh. So she preferred
the couch of the office.

The Who would do a gig, right?

You know, and we would get,
like, for the gig...

...60 pounds, or 50 pounds, right?

Or 30 pounds.
Really small amounts of money, right?

- Right.
- And Kit would figure, "Hey...

...if I take the 30 pounds
to play blackjack...

...I might come out
with a couple of hundred...

...but if we stay with 30, that's not gonna
pay for very much anyway."

So that was one of the systems.

That was a sort of like...
That didn't happen a lot...

...but that was one of the systems.

We had many systems.

<i>I loved it there.
I loved living with Kit...</i>

...because he was passionate, and...

And it was a fantastic
fucking apartment too.

Big, high ceilings
in Eaton Place, you know?

And you'd get in a taxicab, and he'd say,
"Where you going, kid?"

You go, "84 Eaton Place."

He'd go, "Ooh. Ooh."

You know?

<i>You could go into any bank
account and say, "I want to write... "</i>

<i>Coutts or one of these sort of banks,
And say, "I want to open an account."</i>

Dress, and with your accent,
"Eaton PI..."

"Of course, sir."
"And I want an overdraft.

I want a 5000 pound overdraft."
"Of course."

Because they started doing this,
it's what they called...

First one they did it with
was the Bank of Scotland.

And Stamp, they run up this... Write all
the checks up, spend all the money...

...and then skip without paying it back
and open another one.

Stamp used to say, "We're gonna
do another Bank of Scotland job."

<i>And then I also had an older brother...</i>

<i>...who'd become
a successful film actor.</i>

<i>Yeah, it was... He was certainly
making a lot of money, you know?</i>

<i>So he... I would go to him
to get money.</i>

Yeah. I mean, look. We were brothers.

I mean, he didn't just give it to me freely.
I had to sort of promise to pay it back.

Pete said, "I was living there.
Every now and again...

...these teenage boys
would appear at breakfast.

Kit would say, 'This poor boy.
I found him in the street.

Had nowhere to stay.
I said he could stay.'"

Like I say, that fearless quality
because he was...

You know, to be homosexual in...

In those years in London was illegal.

I was in the bedroom next to his,
looking to offer him tea in the morning...

...and there'd be
some boy in bed with him.

But he never once
tried to seduce me...

...and I remember feeling quite
pissed off at one point, thinking:

"Aren't I good-looking enough?"

It wasn't that I wanted to be gay.

I thought he should at least
try it on if he's gay.

And I shared the flat with him
at the office.

Mind you, I was with
a beautiful girl as well. Ha-ha-ha.

Maybe she came between us.
Ha-ha-ha.

He'd wear these suits.

Beautiful cut suits from Savile Row...

...but always be like this
and buttoned up wrong.

And they'd all be... And he, I mean...

...I've never known anybody like
Kit to smoke. Chain-smoke.

He'd chain-smoke
Player's or Senior Service.

These were the best cigarettes.
Untipped.

One after the other,
he'd light one from...

We think he used one match in his whole
life to light the very first one.

<i>Kit remembered he was, like, 9...</i>

<i>...when, you know, one of the artists
who his father was fucking or knew...</i>

<i>...or what, you know,
offered Kit his first cigarette.</i>

<i>"Here, you want a cigarette, Kit?"</i>

<i>There was no sort of...
The fact that he was a child.</i>

<i>He'd have cigarettes all over the place.</i>

And also, he was renowned
for setting things alight.

The number of sofas he'd gone through.
In those days, sofas had horsehair.

And he'd always leave cigarettes,
and they'd fall down...

You know,
people would say things like:

"Kit's late, what's happened?"
And they'd say, "Another fire."

And when I started to talk
to Kit about classical music...

...and Baroque music,
he immediately just simply...

He didn't bother to try to educate me.

He just chucked records at me
that were from his father's collection.

So, wow, you know.

Wow, wow, wow.

He started playing classical music.

Purcell and English classical music
that his father had championed.

These... You know, and stuff like that.

And Pete said as a result
of listening to this sort of stuff:

"I developed my chord sounds"
like in "Kids Are Alright."

The middle-chord bit was based on
some particular Purcell...

...or music that Kit had played him.

Because of his father's background...

...he knew that you could add these
three-minute pieces up...

...to make a much more important...

...dramatic piece.

And...

And he had that in him
right from the beginning.

He kept, you know:

He was always trying
to put things in a...

He taught me about the dramatics
of a stage show.

<i>"It has to kind of be like this, Roger."</i>

"Really? What? No.
Yeah, but wait."

My mentoring Kit in the...

In lots of the overview of the content
of the songs that Pete was writing...

<i>...we, the three of us,
were working on that angle...</i>

<i>...with Pete,
how we were staging them...</i>

<i>...how they looked on stage
and how those things developed...</i>

<i>...you know, just fell to me.</i>

And then we had wrongly signed a
sort of standard-type of recording deal...

<i>...because we didn't know
and went into this deal.</i>

<i>And after we'd been in the studio
for about three times...</i>

<i>...with this producer, we realized, wow,
we'd let go of an essential ingredient...</i>

<i>...to the whole process,
which was the studio work.</i>

We had to be in the studio
directing everything.

We couldn't have an outsider doing that.
This guy was an outsider.

He was a professional producer.

Some say he was very clever,
and very good, but he wasn't...

He wasn't part of us.
He wasn't seeing the vision.

<i>But it fell naturally into place.</i>

<i>It wasn't really that talked about
and agreed...</i>

...but the in-the-studio producer
would be Kit...

...and I would become like, the more
overall executive producer in the studio.

<i>We had immediate success.
I mean, we had hit records from day one.</i>

And we were never, ever, um,
financially balanced.

I mean, after we had, like...

...four or five hit records,
we had no money whatsoever.

<i>We were being sued, you know?</i>

<i>There were bailiffs outside the office.
It was absolute chaos financially.</i>

Because every sort of forward move
was another level to sort of challenge.

<i>Because
they'd been in the film industry...</i>

<i>...they understood
how a team of people...</i>

<i>...can change the way that you feel
when you're creative and working.</i>

You know, I didn't want to be
in a band until I was 61.

I wanted to be in a band
for a couple of years, you know?

<i>And I think they convinced me
that, um, it was worth staying with.</i>

<i>Particularly, those years that they were
around and we worked as a team.</i>

<i>The support that they gave me
to try new things...</i>

<i>...was really what made it all last.</i>

But there was another magic, which was
that John Entwistle is a fucking genius.

<i>A fucking genius
on the bass guitar.</i>

<i>I mean, an astonishing fucking genius.</i>

<i>You know, it wasn't something that we
were particularly aware of at the time...</i>

<i>...but Jesus Christ, you know,
what he did was just beyond conception.</i>

<i>And that Keith Moon...</i>

...was not a drummer.

<i>He just wasn't a drummer.</i>

<i>You know? He did something else.</i>

<i>You know? And Roger,
of course, is, you know...</i>

<i>...probably the only
conventional figure in the band.</i>

<i>And for years, for years and years
and years, until</i> Tommy...

<i>...he didn't know what the fuck
he was doing in the band.</i>

<i>He didn't know what to do,
how to behave.</i>

<i>And has turned out to be
one of the great...</i>

...modern interpreters,
editors and frontmen...

...of our business.

Not of the business of what Kit
and Chris recognized in the band.

What they recognized there, that was
what was great about Roger then...

...was the fact that he was lost.

And that would he find himself?

<i>♪ I can go any way ♪♪</i>

<i>Kit and Chris were
used to working and creating teams...</i>

<i>...where everybody had a function.</i>

<i>But that also... I suppose that sense
of there only ever being one director.</i>

<i>That doesn't mean that there's only
one creative person in a team.</i>

<i>It just means you have one person
that has to have the last call...</i>

<i>...because otherwise
you'd have chaos.</i>

<i>And rock bands are, by nature, groups
of creative people with no director.</i>

As soon as somebody says,
"By the way, I'm the director."

He goes, "No, I'm the director."
Or, "No, I'm the director."

It's like gang warfare.

<i>And Roger was still a street fighter
in those days.</i>

He would win arguments by looking
at you, and you got the feeling that:

"If I don't acquiesce to his point of view
right now, he's gonna kill me."

<i>It took quite an amount
of wit and intelligence...</i>

<i>...and also people management
for Kit and Chris to be able to juggle it.</i>

<i>And obviously, they must have
kind of manipulated a bit.</i>

But you know,
like all good manipulators...

...you don't notice
when it's done to you.

Didn't he tell Roger he had to
actually get rid of his first wife?

- No.
- No?

Well, he, it was kind of...

- As far as I know, I didn't even know...
- It wasn't good.

...that was Roger's wife.

Yeah, Roger was married
when he was very young.

- And...
- And he was 19...

...and Kit said to him, "It's not a
good idea for you to have a wife."

And so he didn't get rid of his wife
because of that...

...but he actually kept her
out of the picture.

- Right.
- She was not in the picture.

I mean, I remember that Kit
was very, um...

Always concerned, though, that...

...she got money.

The idea I've got
is called "Glittering Girl." It's...

- That's a very good title.
- It's, slightly different to that.

It's more beaty,
more punchy sort of thing.

I'll give you a few bars.

I want it to sort of be very:

- Like that. No, it's got drums...
- Some guitar in...

- ...and where the whole group will be...
- Yeah.

♪ She wasn't a fool ♪

♪ That glittering girl ♪

♪ She followed the rules ♪

- And there's a very quiet bit after that.

Be good for Keith, yeah.

♪ You just gotta shake ♪

Yeah.

♪ She isn't a fool
That slender love figure ♪ ♪

- That sort of...
- That's...

I think, really, that's much
more direct, which...

And when I miss Kit,
is in the studio.

Although, you know, he spent a lot of time
mentoring me as a writer.

<i>There was this sense
that everything about the band...</i>

- ...was being honored in the studio.
- Yeah.

<i>You know, if I'd written three songs...</i>

<i>...and presented them to him,
"They were all good."</i>

<i>That's how his response was.</i>

<i>He had found something good
about all of them.</i>

<i>And he wouldn't,
he wouldn't kind of say:</i>

<i>"And that, they're all good,
but that one's great."</i>

<i>It'd be, "They're all good.
Let's work on that one."</i>

<i>And what I started to realize
over a period of many years...</i>

<i>...was the one that he'd pick to work on
would be the one that he really thought...</i>

<i>...either was promising or great,
and the others, perhaps...</i>

...would just slide into the background.

When I go back through my catalog
of the material...

...that I used to play to Kit...

...there must be 80 percent
of what I wrote...

- ...just went on a back burner.
- Right.

It didn't even get to be heard
by the band until years later.

So I think it's that capacity
that he had...

...to accentuate the positive.

<i>He had a natural ear for commercial.</i>

Something that you could
sell out there.

But the commercial
wasn't just a record.

It was a whole package...

...and that whole package also included
attitude and philosophy, stagecraft...

<i>...and art school kind of ideas.</i>

And I think if you grab an idea
and you run with it...

...the chances are
somebody's gonna sneer at you.

You know, and if it's successful, um...

...and they didn't think of it first,
they're gonna be particularly pissed off.

Well, originally...

..."My Generation" was going to be
like a 16 bar Jimmy Reed song.

You know, um...

♪ People try to pull us down ♪

♪ Talkin' about my generation ♪ ♪

<i>♪ Just because we get around ♪</i>

<i>♪ Talkin' about my generation ♪</i>

<i>♪ Things they do look awfully cold ♪</i>

<i>♪ Talkin' about my generation ♪</i>

♪ Hope I die before I get old ♪

And it was Chris Stamp
who suggested to Pete...

...that the character in the song "My
Generation" have a typical teenage stutter.

<i>♪ Talkin' about my generation ♪</i>

♪ And don't try to dig what we all say ♪ ♪

Nobody else had ever used
such a dynamic...

...and a true dynamic to society...

<i>...as a kid blocked up on pills
with a stutter.</i>

<i>It was so true.</i>

<i>It wasn't a gimmick at all,
because kids stuttered.</i>

<i>Especially when they were on pills...</i>

<i>...on French blues
and black bombers and Drinamyl.</i>

<i>And, it worked, and of course,
it made everybody sit up and take notice.</i>

I've heard a lot about you and the
rest of the group taking drugs, Pete.

Does this mean you're usually blocked up
when you're actually on stage?

No, but it means we're blocked
up all the time, you know.

The intensity was always
to keep The Who...

...like a new form of crime in as much
as they were never meant to be...

...like, a "professional showbiz group."

<i>They weren't handsome,
you know, they weren't nice.</i>

<i>You know, they were outsiders, man.
They were sort of like, misfits.</i>

<i>You know, they were looking to sort of,
like, claim their place.</i>

Remember those shows
that we used to do in cinemas...

...and that guy,
who was a big fan of the band...

...who banned us
from the Granada Circuit...

...because he disapproved
of us smashing our instruments?

- Do you remember that?
- I remember it vaguely.

"And the pity because
you're such a good band."

<i>And it was always me he would
take out and give these lectures.</i>

And I was just reduced to kind of
telling him to fuck off.

Kit was trying to explain,
"You have to have this band on." Yeah.

- This is a different kind of music.
- It's a different kind of thing.

<i>You know, there was something
about not honoring electric guitars.</i>

<i>A, they were electric.</i>

<i>You know, we were looking at sound
as sound, not just music.</i>

<i>The electrification, if you like,
the modernization of life, right?</i>

<i>And us as a generation had seen that
first in destruction, you know...</i>

<i>...in a war, in a... On a beautiful city...</i>

<i>...that we're living in had been bombed.
It was abstract.</i>

<i>And it was a huge statement
for The Who audience...</i>

<i>...because The Who audience
were coming to grips.</i>

<i>The Who audience was trying to, sort of,
like, get some life in their body...</i>

<i>...and life in their head
and life in their hearts.</i>

<i>And life wasn't really offering
them that, you know.</i>

<i>It was offering them a sort of an abstract,
isolated form of life.</i>

<i>You know, they were saying,
here's TV...</i>

<i>...but they were also
being sort of told...</i>

<i>...but, you know, you're still
a working class kid.</i>

<i>You're still white trash.</i>

<i>The group were acting out,
because, you know...</i>

<i>...we were like a fucked up
family system right here, you know.</i>

<i>So there's a lot of like,
weird behaviors going on...</i>

...and one of them was Roger,
whacked Keith Moon...

...and then they had a fight on stage.
Thank God, right?

Thank God it wasn't wasted
in the dressing room.

So they had a fight on stage...

...and, um, Keith said, um...

...that he'd never fucking work
with Roger again.

<i>So Kit and I sort of said, "Okay,
so the band won't be the same band."</i>

<i>You know, so we presented
an idea to them.</i>

We'd create a band around Roger...

...and then the three of them would...
That sort of stuff.

But we were just winging it.

We really wanted them
to be the four guys.

<i>I remember I got
a phone call from Chris...</i>

...and he said that he's spoken to Roger
and that he got him to promise...

...not to resort to violence
to win arguments again.

And I said something like, "Good luck.
I hope you can pull it off."

And, you know, in fact he did.

That was really our only way
of dealing with...

We all had our own methods.

- I would...
- That's right.

You weren't as good as Keith.

He was...

He was incredibly cruel when...
My God, I paid for that day.

<i>I had three years of hell,
and he would deliberately goad me.</i>

He would do anything
just to try and make me explode.

It was a hell.

It was a painful time, and you and I didn't
talk about it really at all at the time.

I was living in the office. Went
from the back of the van to the office.

But he went through
a kind of strange misery of his own.

<i>- Do you remember that thing where he...
- I knew he was miserable.</i>

<i>That period where
he was on stage and he was crying...</i>

<i>- Yeah.
- ...in deep depression.</i>

<i>You could just tell that
there was something that he wanted...</i>

...that he wasn't ever gonna get.

- Yeah.
- And in a way, he wanted us to deliver it.

- Yeah.
- We couldn't deliver it.

And he couldn't articulate it.

I remember you were always
more sympathetic to him than I was...

...when he was in that state.
"Fuck off," you know?

I remember you going up
and putting your arm around him...

...and saying,
"What can... What is it, mate?

- What can we do?"
- Yeah.

And I remember saying
to you, "Tell him to fuck...

You know, stop taking his stupid
whatever it is he's taking."

And you said, "No, there's something
wrong with him.

There's something deeply wrong here."

And he was just... He had a...
What looked like a nervous breakdown.

He was obviously on some drug or other.
But it had led to a condition...

...that was definitely
a manic depression.

- It lasted for about two weeks.
- Yeah, yeah.

- And...
- Like he became schizophrenic.

- Wasn't it? Very strange.
- Yeah.

I think we all knew what we had.
I remember thinking certainly...

...if this band breaks apart now...

...what I've got left
is never gonna equal it.

We somehow eased that through,
diplomatically, ahem...

...and Roger...

...wonderfully agreed
to stop hitting people.

And he's stood up to that
until today.

And they... And it worked.

So their end of the family
was broken up for a period...

...and we managed to sort of
get over the breakup...

...you know, and come back together.

And then there were lots
of bits and pieces like that.

- I was thrown out.
- No, I was thrown out.

- No, I was thrown out too.
- Ha-ha-ha.

Now what actually happened was that
I discovered that Keith and John...

...were forming this group
with Jimmy Page called Led Zeppelin.

That's what they were up to.
God knows I'd had no idea...

<i>...that they were gonna form
a heavy metal band...</i>

<i>...which is what they were talking
about doing, John and Keith.</i>

I'd gone through that thing in Paris...

...of hearing, um, Keith and John
talking about me behind my back...

<i>...in a way that was
very, very disparaging.</i>

Dear, dear Pete.

I was about to go into a hotel room
and be with them, and I just turned back...

...and I went to my room
and just sat there and thought.

I felt like a real outsider.

<i>Kit and I were in a club. We saw
Jimi. He's just played with the group.</i>

<i>It wasn't his show.</i>

<i>He just jammed with the group,
and we saw that...</i>

<i>...and we heard him as well.</i>

<i>And we saw him,
and we thought he's amazing.</i>

<i>And we went up afterwards,
and Chas Chandler was there...</i>

<i>...and we realized that Chas
was the guy taking care of him.</i>

<i>So Jimi's sort of standing there,
and we're talking to Chas...</i>

<i>...and we said to Chas, "Listen, does he...</i>

<i>Can we... Can we produce him?" Right?
And Chas said, "Well, I'm doing that."</i>

<i>We said, "Okay."
We said, "Can we manage him?"</i>

<i>And he said, "Well, The Animals,
you know, Mike, is doing that."</i>

<i>And we said,
"Has he got a record label?"</i>

And he said, "No."
We said, "We'll do that then." Heh.

And we had talked about
having a record label...

...but we'd never actually...
We hadn't actually put it into place.

So we immediately put it into place
to get Jimi.

So you offered
Jimi Hendrix a record deal...

...but you didn't actually have
a record company?

Right, that's right, that's right.

We didn't have a record company,
but we intended to have one.

And so he was the beginning.

Kit was the first guy...

...to start an independent record label...

...you know, in the world.

And he went to Polydor
and he got a deal.

I had got that artwork done of the f...

You know, have you ever seen
the Track Record artwork?

You know, it's like a...
It's a stylus on a record.

<i>The arm of the stylus
coming out onto a record...</i>

<i>...only it's a T, but that was the design.</i>

<i>- I mean, and it was done overnight.
- Track was the other home.</i>

<i>- It's where everyone went.
- It was great. It was a great vibe.</i>

<i>And you didn't say
I'm going down the office.</i>

- No, no, no.
- Going down to Track.

And it wasn't very much
of an office, was it?

- It was great.
- It was great.

- It was wonderful.
- But, I mean, it wasn't...

There wasn't a lot of, sort of,
like, business going on there.

- Do you remember?
- It felt like it.

<i>But it was ideas driven, right?
It was ideas driven.</i>

But you've got sufficient
financial backing.

Hold on, sir. Kit? Problem.

- Phillip's had his guitar stolen.
- Christ. Um...

- Can you try and borrow one from Pete?
- I'll get on to Pete straight away.

<i>We wanted to do all of this
message stuff, but we embraced all of it.</i>

We were not afraid
of commercialism at all.

I am the god of hellfire!

And I bring you...

♪ Fire ♪

<i>♪ I'll take you to burn ♪♪</i>

<i>Track was the first time you
and Kit did anything outside of The Who...</i>

...and then all of the sudden,
Kit was producing other artists.

<i>And it did feel strange
to me at the time.</i>

<i>Kit, to his credit, used to include me.
I mean, when Arthur Brown was doing...</i>

<i>...when he was mixing
"Fire," he'd say, "Come down.</i>

<i>I want you to help me mix it."</i>

But it's just how it felt.
It was very strange.

Is it going to be an R and B
label or an experimental label?

We're gonna have a lot
of experimental stuff on it.

In fact, Pete Townshend is...

...heading up
a mysterious department...

...called Jazz and New Sounds.
<i>- For me, the Track years...</i>

...were exciting because
I had Thunderclap Newman.

- Right.
- While I was doing demos for <i>Tommy...</i>

...I'm knocking the demos for <i>Tommy</i> out,
you know, I'm working on...

...this little band, you know...

...and kind of cooking stuff up
out of nothing, having this brain fart.

Thinking, "That guitar player,
that guy, put them together." Da-da-da-da.

- Yeah.
- Next thing, it was number one.

So there's this sense that,
"This is easy." You know?

It was only hard because
before it was with The Who.

You know, they're very hard.
They're difficult.

But when you work
with somebody else, it's easy.

<i>Arthur Brown, number one.</i>

<i>You know, "Something In The Air,"
number one.</i>

<i>You know, Jimi Hendrix, number one.</i>

Marc Bolan and John's Children
with "Ride A White Swan," number one.

We couldn't get fucking number ones.
Everybody else was getting number one.

<i>Track had four number ones
in a row with other artists.</i>

<i>Marsha Hunt went to number four.</i>

<i>I mean, you know,
ours were down at ten, 14. Ha, ha.</i>

No. Hold on, sir. Kit?

The feeling I had was that
we were never gonna make it in America.

- Yeah.
- Never in a million years.

I just remember kind of
looking at the kind of bands...

...that were making it
in America, thinking, you know...

...if they like Eric Burdon, we're fucked.

Where especially in the States
would you like to visit?

- California, I think.
- Why California?

There's a good recording
studio over there, Western.

And the surfing and hot rods.

Yeah. Surfing and the hot rods
and the girls over there.

Why do you want to record in
America? Why does this appeal to you?

It's because it's different
from recording here.

- Sunnier.
- Better studios.

No, I'm just... I'm not worried
about the studios or the sound.

But when you go outside,
you can get a tan...

<i>...which is more than you can get here.</i>

<i>We really saw
the huge complexity of what America is.</i>

<i>Can you imagine Jackson, Mississippi...</i>

<i>...Chicago, Detroit, you know,
and then Baton Rouge.</i>

<i>And we went everywhere on this tour
in this horrible old prop plane.</i>

<i>And it had bunks in it.</i>

<i>These sort of, like, rope bunks.</i>

<i>It was really shitty, but it was...
We were all on it, all these three groups.</i>

And there was a sort of
old sort of American tour manager.

And especially in the South,
when the plane had st...

You know, landed and we were
about to get out...

...he would stand at the door before we
get out and he would tell us all...

...he'd say, "Listen, in this state...

...fucking women who are under,
you know, over, under 20 or..."

- Because it was different in every state.
- Every time he said:

"Because you could go to prison for this.
You could do this," you know.

So the local rules
of where we were going...

...were always told to us
before we got off the plane.

And they were mostly about fucking.

<i>♪ Magic bus ♪♪</i>

<i>And then they started
releasing really mediocre songs...</i>

<i>...like "Magic Bus", "Dogs",
"Call Me Lightning", things like this...</i>

<i>...that were sort of not really
up to The Who's standard.</i>

<i>And he said, "Well, we've run out
of songs basically."</i>

<i>And it looked very much
like it was the end of the band.</i>

<i>Before</i> Tommy <i>we were
finished. Without something audacious...</i>

<i>...The Who were done for.
So, you know...</i>

<i>...somewhere there,
Kit and I took a gamble.</i>

I spoke earlier about the fact that...

...Kit had nurtured me as a composer.

I don't mean a songwriter.

I mean a composer.
I wanted to learn to orchestrate...

<i>...and I wanted to write an opera.
Kit came in sideways...</i>

...and he was the one that,
in a sense, accused me of vanity.

He said, "You know,
The Who need a new single."

You know, and I said, "Well, you know,
I'm working on this opera."

He said, "Well, you know,
how's it gonna help The Who?"

And I said, "Don't know."

<i>He said, "Well, what have you got?" I said,
"I've got this, this, this, and this."</i>

<i>We were just totally immersed
in this venture.</i>

You know, the... Any growth,
any personal self-growth...

...was happening within this space.

It didn't really happen outside of it.

It started to end about 19...

You know, that closeness
began to end, really, after <i>Tommy.</i>

That's the... That's the
second era, so to speak.

<i>Tommy</i> was the major turning
point for that band.

You know,
there was up to <i>Tommy...</i>

...and after <i>Tommy.</i>

And <i>Tommy</i> was the turning point.

Pete said to me, he said,
at the time of <i>Tommy...</i>

...it was the first time
the word "million" ever appeared.

<i>By the end of five years,
we had produced</i> Tommy.

<i>We'd done all
the opera house tours.</i>

<i>You know, we created
a new way of touring.</i>

<i>And it was just
a very short period of time.</i>

<i>And 1969, with</i> Tommy <i>was
when we first had some money.</i>

<i>So we had worked all of this...</i>

<i>...without ever having
any real sort of safety money...</i>

<i>...constantly in debt.</i>

And <i>Tommy</i> made so much money...

...that we had
to have some money.

It beat us, you know.

We didn't care,
but it did, you know.

<i>It outgrossed
even our sort of expenditure.</i>

he was hanging on to the mod thing...</i>

And he grew it long,
and it was just curly.

And Kit always said, "Wow...

an amazing job with Roger.

- Ha-ha-ha.
- She's got him to do the right hair."

And he always, thought

That was what Kit and...

And if Chris was in the room now
he would be nodding. I know he would.

Because we got this
very, very early on...

<i>...and we reinforced it in each other.</i>

Ladies and gentlemen...

The Who.

<i>Typical Kit and Chris thing,
when they were gonna break</i> Tommy...

<i>...they wanted it to play
at all the opera houses...</i>

<i>...all over the world...</i>

<i>...and they were gonna try and break
into the Leningrad Opera House...</i>

<i>...or the Moscow Opera House
or something like that.</i>

<i>Stamp went to Russia and tried
to persuade them to...</i>

<i>You can imagine. This was, like,
we're talking about 1969.</i>

I used to go to events
at the Russian Embassy...

...and watch four-hour totally boring films
on Lenin and all that, you know.

As I was a bit of an expert on Lenin,
I could hold my own. But it was awful.

<i>We wanted to get
Moscow Opera House...</i>

<i>...and we wanted to get
the Metropolitan Opera House.</i>

<i>And we wanted to sort of
have the headline:</i>

"Rock Breaks the Iron Curtain,"
you know, when we flew from Moscow.

<i>They wouldn't give us
their fucking opera house.</i>

They offered us St. Petersburg,
but it was years down the road, you know.

And in rock 'n' roll terms,
that was like a century, right?

And who are The Who?

Well, The Who are The Who,
that's who they are.

A rock group,
veterans of Woodstock...

...and now the authors
and performers in a rock-opera.

- You could feel the vibrations.
- Man, we freaked it all out.

- It's beautiful.
- It's unreal.

Without the libretto, it was more difficult
than Italian opera.

The seats are comfortable,
aren't they?

<i>Keith Moon loved the melodrama...</i>

<i>...and the pomposity of,
"Shut up, it's a fucking opera!"</i>

<i>You know?</i>

<i>John Entwistle got to play
the French horn...</i>

...and I could see
that it maybe might give Kit...

...his big movie
that he'd always wanted.

<i>The relationship that I had with Kit...</i>

<i>...was about the fact that he...</i>

...right from the very, very beginning...

...was quite clearly
a frustrated composer.

<i>So he saw in me...</i>

...a chance to expound
some of his own frustrated ideas.

<i>He encouraged the preposterous.</i>

<i>The more preposterous, the better.</i>

The more adventurous,
the more dangerous...

...the more exotic, the more absurd.

<i>Tommy</i> was a mess.
It was typical Townshend thing.

He'd have a song here, something there,
a bit of music there, something here...

...some abandoned project there,
a laundry list there.

And he put it all together
and try and get some sort of...

...great concept out of it.

But Kit, because of his, I suppose...

...scriptwriting experience
on films and stuff...

...put it into some order...

...because he was writing the script
as <i>Tommy</i> was recorded.

Pete may have always known
the story inside, right?

We know it was about
this deaf, dumb and blind boy...

...it's about vibes.

I mean, the original idea
is deaf, dumb and blind boy.

Um, he... Vibes, this was,
like, '68, right? Acid was big.

It was all about vibes,
all about connection.

The infinity of the universe...

...of eternity, of all the eternal
aspects of the universe...

...aware of the invalidity...

...of what we know as reality.

Reality with a small R.

<i>Kit found it very, very difficult...</i>

...when I started to study
spiritual matters.

And, particularly,
the work of Inayat Khan...

...the Sufi Master
who was a master musician.

Kit, you know, was just...
He just wanted it to stop.

Yeah, but that's like
fucking hippie-dippy, right?

Which it was.
Come on, I mean, like, vibes, you know?

Deaf, dumb and blind, that bit's good.
But how did he get deaf, dumb and blind?

<i>Tommy</i> began
as a spiritual allegory...

...and he made it
a story of postwar life.

So we had the lover come home
with the husband from the war...

...kill the lover, the kid sees it,
the lover and mother shake the kid.

"You didn't hear it."
And traumatize him, right?

So he goes into trauma,
becomes deaf, dumb and blind.

Then he tries some acid...

...the Acid Queen, to bring him back...

...and he's growing up,
and never gets back.

Then he has a breakup,
and he gets enlightened...

...he has a sort of spiritual experience
and becomes an enlightened being.

When Pete was writing the songs...

...and it was his original idea...

...um, within the studio context...

...it wasn't clear
where it was going...

...where it was gonna end.

I mean, the songs, the bad stuff,
the shitty stuff...

...you know, Uncle Ernie,
who's a fucking pedophile, right?

And Cousin Kevin who's a bully, right?

You know, the real stuff
that happens in life.

You know, John Entwistle
wrote those songs.

He was more of a sort of, you know,
nasty, cynical, grounded type of being.

<i>Do you know what I mean?
That he could write that horrible shit...</i>

<i>...because John was a very dark guy.</i>

What was it that you
went to see this doctor for?

- I had a poisoned finger.
- A poisoned finger.

- How did you get it?
- It was weeping.

<i>When we asked him,
there was a big grin on his face.</i>

<i>"I'll write them, sure."</i>

Kit wrote a screenplay...

...only as a guideline...

...for the guys in the studio.

Remember,
we didn't have any money...

...we were in a sort of cheap studio...

...and come Thursday we would pack up,
put it in the van...

...because the group
had to go out and perform...

...to get the money.

They couldn't take time off
to actually record.

And Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights
were the big earners, right?

Then they would come back in.
So it was always lost all over the place.

Sometimes they would go out
and play some songs they recorded...

...then come back,
they want to re-record them.

So Kit wrote this screenplay
as a way to give it structure.

And he showed it to Pete.

And he'd noted where there should be
some songs and stuff like that.

Now, whether that fell in line
with Pete's overall vision, I don't know.

And, certainly,
let me put it this way:

Pete doesn't really give credit
for the screenplay to Kit.

So, it's an un... It's a mystery.

He started to bring in the idea...

...that there was
a postwar element in there.

But, you know, I already had songs
like "Captain Walker Didn't Come Home."

I already had songs about, you know...

...child abuse and brutality
and bullying and, you know...

So, you know, it was all there,
you know, it's my story.

And he came up with a few things
that were really fundamentally important:

The idea of doing an overture,
which I did at the end...

...and also the idea
of repeating the refrain at the end...

...the "Listening To You"
prayer at the end...

...putting that at the end.
I think that's some ideas he had...

...but we were all
rather kind of groping.

The film was gonna be produced
and directed by Lambert/Stamp.

I mean, no one else, right?

So we're gonna make this film,
and we're gonna make it our way.

We're gonna cast it our way...

...and we're gonna sort of, like, do it,
and it's gonna be another level.

And suddenly, Pete Townshend
balks at this idea.

The first sort of "pfft" in the camp.

Right? The first breakup.

<i>You know, just on an emotional
level, you know...</i>

<i>...Kit and I weren't even gonna attempt
to make the movie without Pete.</i>

<i>What had happened
was that they'd come at me with a script...</i>

<i>...with a treatment,
and I wouldn't look at it.</i>

<i>I'm not... You know,
I'm not gonna allow a film to be made.</i>

<i>I'm not gonna allow you to make a film.
Because I didn't want to lose them.</i>

<i>I felt already that they were going...</i>

<i>...I thought they were going to
Hollywood, so I wouldn't look at it.</i>

<i>And what was bad about it
was the way I'd handled it.</i>

And what I see now
is Pete was afraid, now...

...that if Lambert and Stamp
do the film...

...then Lambert and Stamp...

...being the producer-managers
of The Who is sort of over.

We have also...
We've completed our cycle...

...we've come back to make...
And we make our film, and we leave.

We become the bad parents
who are abandoning them, right?

What happened was,
is that Kit appropriated it...

...the piece, as an opportunity
to make a movie.

He took the story,
he wrote a script around it...

...which was loosely based on
the story that I'd written.

Um...

And...

Registered it as a grand right.

And took it to Universal...

...and tried to persuade them
to make a movie and...

Meanwhile, I was on to the next thing,
you know, so...

And, <i>Tommy,</i>
he never got to make <i>Tommy...</i>

...but felt that he should do,
you know, and...

Um...

And we never really worked together
again after that.

<i>In Kit's myth, he'd been
conceived in Venice, if you like.</i>

<i>His father and mother
were on their honeymoon...</i>

<i>...or Constant was playing
some sort of orchestra or something.</i>

And Kit had this thing about Venice...

...that it was his...
There was some other draw.

<i>In 1971, um, Kit rented a floor
of a palazzo on the Grand Canal...</i>

<i>...and it was quite, quite magical.</i>

He obviously
developed a taste for Venice...

...because very soon
he bought his own palazzo...

...the Palazzo Dario.

<i>Kit bought it from
some Italian nobleman.</i>

Or rather the estate
of some Italian nobleman...

...who had been murdered
by his Yugoslav boyfriend...

...I think,
about six or seven months before.

And Jane and I found ourselves
sleeping in the murder bedroom.

And one morning, I was scrambling about
under the bed for my slippers...

...and I felt something sort of
slightly soft and plastic.

And I touched it, and I realized
that it was a gout of blood.

<i>By that time, Kit was becoming
quite well known.</i>

<i>He was known as "Il Barone,"
"Il Barone Lambert."</i>

And so I think when he started
to make good money...

...I think he rather anticipated...

...the receiving of money
by spending it early...

<i>...but eventually
he did make a lot of money.</i>

And so everyone had money,
for the first time.

Now, that was sort of needed,
nice for everyone to have some security.

<i>And so when the</i> Tommy <i>thing
didn't continue...</i>

...straight on into a film,
there was this sort of gap.

You know, the actual life
that came about was normal life...

...and we all wanted some normal life.

<i>People had started
to buy houses...</i>

<i>...and John had gotten married.</i>

<i>He'd married his schoolgirl
sweetheart, and, um...</i>

<i>They've also started
to make babies...</i>

...you know, have girlfriends.

Kit found me having
a conventional little family...

...that was gonna lead to me having
children and a house and stuff...

...he found it very bourgeois.

<i>And was quite antagonistic.</i>

They're not quite
as, dangerously out of control...

...right, as Kit and I.

I mean, you know,
we were gonna go to the edge.

<i>Kit went to New York
and started to produce records there...</i>

<i>...and had some success.</i>

<i>The life of New York then was...
You know, matched Kit's own decadence.</i>

<i>There was a lot of coke,
a lot of drugs...</i>

<i>...a lot of, like, action, whatever.</i>

<i>I cried when Kit called me
and invited me to New York to work...</i>

<i>...because I'd kind of really lost heart
in the</i> Lifehouse <i>project.</i>

<i>Battering away, battering away,
battering away...</i>

<i>...trying to get people to get inside what
it was that I was trying to get across.</i>

<i>I knew I had this great music...</i>

<i>...but just not the craft and skills
to deliver a story that made sense...</i>

<i>...and not any idea
about how it would work...</i>

...that was a hopeful return
to a project...

...if not a frontline production process...

...certainly one in which he would have
some kind of mentoring figure in it...

- That's right, that's right.
- ...as he had on <i>Tommy.</i>

The next rift type of thing
came about with...

...what became
the <i>Who's Next</i> album.

The <i>Who's Next</i> album
was a conceptual project...

...a rock opera called <i>Lifehouse.</i>

<i>And Kit didn't actually think
the piece was right...</i>

...because he thought the idea,
which was a mystical idea...

...was too mystical.

And also, I think, unconsciously Kit was,
like, wounded in a sense of saying:

"Why should I work with Pete
on <i>Lifehouse?</i>

So you can fuck me
when I wanna make a film of it?"

I don't know. That's purely come
to my head for the first time.

Kit did help. Um...

He brought us to New York, where he
was based, working with Patti LaBelle.

And he thought we should invite all
the great New York musicians to help.

Just... Not actually to do finished
recordings. That wasn't Kit's idea.

The idea of Kit's was to, sort of,
shift the focus.

Um, Pete had had issues with Kit
on production, um...

...of <i>Who's Next,</i> which was kind of
all a bit of a mystery...

...to the rest of the band,
because something happened...

...between Pete and Kit,
and we don't know what.

We went to... We did
some recording of <i>Who's Next...</i>

...in New York,
which sounded great to me.

Um...

Came back to England,
and the next thing we know...

...we're gonna re-record it.

<i>And these decisions were all
made by Pete, who, you know...</i>

<i>...now was gaining
more and more control.</i>

<i>Kit was making
a new life in New York.</i>

<i>There was a sort of a sense
of safety for Kit in that world.</i>

<i>We didn't see what Kit was building
for himself there, and how carefully...</i>

<i>...he was structuring it, and how it was
very much from his old world.</i>

<i>It became clear that Kit
was in bad shape...</i>

...but the most important thing
was that Keith was...

It wasn't right for Keith to be
working in New York.

<i>He was using narcotics,
and we were very worried about him.</i>

So we had him and Kit
at the same time...

...and it was almost like, you know,
who do we keep an eye on?

<i>At the end, on</i> Quadrophenia...

<i>...when we got to the studio,
Kit did that thing...</i>

...of showing up about
two or three hours late.

Did really lose my temper with him
one night, because he was so disruptive.

What happened?

I just... You know,
just kind of went for him and...

I didn't do anything, I didn't hit him.
I really wanted to.

I wanted to throw him down the stairs.

And he started to cry, and he was...

He was obviously in very bad shape.

You know, he suddenly broke down.

I was saying to him,
"You let me down, you let me down."

"This is a very hard project.
I can't do it on my own. It's too hard.

There's so much to do."
I'd just come out of...

I was in the middle of, actually...
Dealing with two other quite big things.

One was... I'd got involved with,
Eric Clapton...

...and his, you know, recovery
from the grave of the day.

But also we were preparing
the <i>Tommy</i> film.

So I was really quite hard-pressed
and really wanted...

Just needed a bit of help with...

Because it was kind of done,
but it needed a bit of...

It needed Kit, really.

And, um...

Anyway, it would have been a different
ball of string if he'd have been around.

But that was the last attempt
that he had of...

At being, you know, part of things.

<i>I went to collect Kit
from a nursing home.</i>

<i>I think he was drying out from alcohol. I
went to collect him from a nursing home...</i>

<i>...I think in Redding,
to drive him to stay with us.</i>

And he insisted on saying:

"I want to stop somewhere
on the way."

And he stopped off
at a wine merchant's.

And although he was not meant
to be drinking himself...

...he brought us three bottles
of some of the most wonderful claret...

...I've ever drunk in my life.

<i>Kit's idea of Venice... He bought
the palazzo. He would start to write there.</i>

<i>This was a bit of a idealistic dream,
but he... That was his idea.</i>

<i>Track was gonna transship
vinyl to Russia and to India...</i>

<i>...you know,
which you couldn't do business.</i>

<i>Records weren't allowed to be sold.</i>

<i>So we would transship them
for goods through Venice, right?</i>

<i>Which was just
a very solid business idea.</i>

<i>It was before the Wall came down...</i>

<i>...and there was this whole market
of rock 'n' roll that wanted it madly.</i>

<i>And we would give it to them
and take all the money.</i>

<i>But we would then leave it in Venice.</i>

<i>And Kit's idea was to create all
the money for Venice In Peril.</i>

<i>That's what Kit wanted.
To save Venice, because...</i>

<i>...he considered it an incredible
artistic creative center.</i>

<i>So his idea was to, sort of, do things
that were socially, sort of, giving.</i>

<i>I'd offered all the four members of
The Who...</i>

<i>...ten percent each of Track Records.</i>

<i>The idea was that Track Records
would become, like, the bigger company.</i>

<i>They would be partners in it,
and that they would come into the fold.</i>

<i>Our roles as managers and, sort of,
day-to-day, sort of, studio producers...</i>

...would fade into something else...

...as they become bigger,
to be part of this thing.

And they refused this.

<i>It was a gift to say to these guys:</i>

"We are tired of this job and
we're not so together anymore."

You know, "Come in and
help us in a different way."

And, you know, what we weren't good at
was we weren't good at the psychology.

Because, you know,
we were saying to them:

"We don't want to be your managers
anymore, come in to Track."

And they took it badly.

<i>I've had conversation with Roger
subsequently...</i>

<i>...and, um, I mean,
he's just very emotional.</i>

<i>I mean, he'd created the band,
more or less. He's the leader of the band.</i>

<i>He'd had a terrible time because that was
taken away from him, you know?</i>

<i>The leadership, per se.</i>

<i>And he was really concerned...</i>

<i>...that, like, the way that Kit
and I were, in our drug using...</i>

<i>...or whatever it was,
that a lot of damage would be done.</i>

<i>The early '70s
coincided with two things.</i>

<i>You know, one was The Who becoming
a road war machine, and the other...</i>

...with Kit Lambert becoming
a heroin addict.

In 1973, he explained that he was
in a bad way, and he admitted...

...he was taking a lot of drugs,
and he wanted...

He asked me if I would
represent his interests.

And I said, "Look, I really am not
cut out for this kind of thing."

<i>And I helped Bill Curbishley
organize a European tour...</i>

<i>...sometime in sixty...
In '74, I think it was.</i>

I have to say I was not cut out for it.

Um, and it was difficult to talk
to Kit about it at that time...

...because if I tried to ask him questions,
"Now, what do you think?

<i>How should we... What sort of
percentage should we ask for The Who?"</i>

<i>He didn't want to talk about that.
He wanted to talk about something else.</i>

He didn't seem to want
to talk about business at all.

<i>In 19... Was it '74? I had to instigate...</i>

...leaving them as managers,
because it was so out of control.

<i>Not, um...</i>

<i>Not an easy decision.</i>

<i>The Who have become
a multimillion-pound corporation.</i>

<i>Their business empire is based
here at Shepperton Studios...</i>

<i>...where their trucking, laser and sound
equipment businesses are housed.</i>

<i>During the last few years, The Who's
other interests have diversified so much...</i>

<i>...that people have wondered whether
they're musicians or businessmen.</i>

<i>Director Ken Russell
and producer Robert Stigwood...</i>

<i>...have made a film of</i> Tommy.

<i>Kit saw my betrayal
as</i> Tommy <i>the film.</i>

<i>The unspoken deal was that him and...
You know, Lambert and Stamp...</i>

<i>...would make the rock film.
And when I went with Stigwood...</i>

<i>And I went with him because
it was still difficult at that stage.</i>

<i>Elton John, Eric Clapton...</i>

<i>So Stigwood equals Ken Russell
equaled Columbia, and that's basically it.</i>

<i>And then Stigwood said to me, um,
you know, "But I can't have Kit around."</i>

<i>Your senses will never be the same.</i>

<i>And when Kit was going
slightly mad, slightly off the wall...</i>

<i>...more eccentric than normal,
he got very frightened of Kit.</i>

<i>Kit felt sort of rejected by me.</i>

<i>He felt rejected by Pete.</i>

He didn't feel rejected by Keith.

Keith made it very clear
that he was there for him, you know?

But he... But the two... The two poles
in his life were Pete and me. Ahem.

If I tried to deal with him, he would be
firing pieces of handwritten paper at me...

...which were the writs that he was
gonna smack on the film.

He somehow let go.

This kind of classic addiction,
alcoholic stuff.

Unable to hang on to reality,
but just falling into...

...you know, deep, deep, deep anger
and resentment.

You know, deeply felt resentment,
which eats and eats and eats away...

...and in the end, you know,
you're the one that gets it.

<i>It's a drag.</i>

<i>I'm... I'm still functioning.</i>

<i>I'm the one who's functioning.
Kit isn't functioning.</i>

<i>His life was getting incredibly
complicated. He'd lost his house...</i>

<i>Um, being a ward of the court,
he didn't have...</i>

<i>...the freedom to access his money
and all those things, right?</i>

<i>Well, his view of me
changed around...</i>

<i>Um, he was getting slightly paranoid.</i>

<i>He didn't think he was being confided in
and respected in the way...</i>

<i>...he thought he should be
by The Who, whatever, right?</i>

<i>He's paranoid. Paranoid is a paranoia.
It's a type of mental illness, right?</i>

<i>It's the same as, like, being a
mentally-ill alcoholic or an addict, right?</i>

<i>You're not quite in touch with reality,
per se.</i>

And at the end of that,
Roger and I had to kind of...

...just face the fact that it was
kind of up to us really.

You know, and that was hard,
that was a hard lesson...

...because we'd never really
established a proper, sort of, working...

You know, a way of working together.

Kit had been the intermediary, you know?
He was who we worked for. Through.

You know, we struggled and I don't think
we ever really found a way...

...of working together that was as good
as having him there.

<i>♪ I went to Dallas back in '82 ♪♪</i>

<i>Keith was in California.</i>

<i>I stayed with him in California,
he was going through a bad time.</i>

<i>I stayed in his house, was there for him.
I tried to get his record together.</i>

<i>I tried to like clean him up
as best as I could, right?</i>

<i>Whatever it was.
I was just there as his friend, right?</i>

<i>He moved in with Kit.</i>

<i>Right? At one time, and then...</i>

<i>...he also would
come over to my house.</i>

<i>In the complaint from The Who
to the various companies, right...</i>

<i>I mean, the time
it was originally signed...</i>

<i>...it was only actually signed
by Roger and John.</i>

<i>So Pete had eventually
gone along with it.</i>

But Keith had been
the one member of the group...

...who refused to sign
those legal documents...

...against Kit and I.

He said, "I'm not gonna sign anything
to do with hurting Kit or Chris."

<i>So we had one meeting where Keith
and the whole group were there.</i>

<i>And Sam Sylvester
was listing off the things...</i>

<i>...that were on the original complaint.</i>

<i>And every time there was
something about Kit and Chris...</i>

<i>...Keith would answer.</i>

<i>When money was missing,
"No, you don't understand.</i>

<i>Kit and Chris had to spend money
getting me out of prison.</i>

<i>Kit and Chris had to..."
You know?</i>

<i>He was the best defense lawyer
on our behalf.</i>

<i>Um, so, when...</i>

<i>...um, he died...</i>

<i>The Who, with their lawyers...</i>

<i>...wanted to get together with me
the day after the funeral.</i>

<i>They came here, right?</i>

<i>To Shepperton Studios,
where Kit and I met.</i>

<i>The Who own
Shepperton Studios, right?</i>

<i>And so... But that was
the symbol of Keith dying...</i>

<i>...and then this meeting.</i>

<i>So when I walked in here,
into this boardroom, at Shepperton here...</i>

<i>...that was my frame of mind.</i>

<i>And we waited about...
It was over half an hour.</i>

<i>And the person who lived nearest
to Shepperton was Pete...</i>

<i>...and he was the one that was late.</i>

<i>We're in the old house
having this meeting...</i>

...discussing the management, right?

I'm there with my lawyer, in a raincoat,
my one lawyer.

<i>There's a bank of lawyers
on the other side of the table.</i>

And this is going on and, like...

...I'm getting more and more crazy...

...that I'm being sued
for mismanagement, right?

Kit isn't there, Kit didn't show up.
I don't have my support around me.

<i>Kit is not doing well.</i>

<i>My life is pretty fucked up...</i>

<i>...and my wife is...
You know, I'm not with my wife.</i>

<i>And for me, in that state of mind
that I was in...</i>

<i>I just didn't want to continue anymore.
And so that was in my mind.</i>

<i>I'm looking at this place...</i>

<i>...this studio that, um,
Kit and I met at, right...</i>

<i>...that The Who now own.</i>

<i>Right? And I stood up and I said:</i>

"Do you call this fucking
mismanagement?" Right?

You know, referring to...
They own Shepperton Studios.

I mean, what is fabulous management?

This is mismanagement? Right?

Anyway, I was trying to do
the best I could.

<i>But the best I could...</i>

<i>...didn't include Kit...</i>

<i>...because I couldn't get him
to the table.</i>

<i>I was a manager...</i>

<i>...and I wasn't able to hold my ground.</i>

<i>It's like, you know...</i>

<i>...you can't get the lighting right,
and you're the cameraman.</i>

<i>That's what I was doing.</i>

<i>I didn't have film in the camera.
You know.</i>

I knew that there was no way...

...to, sort of,
nicely move through this impasse.

So I just, as sensibly as I could...

...I tried to resolve a way
to just sign off from these guys.

<i>Because I was in the studio...</i>

<i>...and because this is where
Kit and I first met...</i>

<i>...and it was just so...
It was all overwhelming.</i>

<i>So this place
of the beginning of all things...</i>

<i>...in my young life...</i>

<i>Becoming an assistant director
at Shepperton for the first time...</i>

<i>...and all of that...</i>

<i>...it had all just ended up
like this, you know?</i>

When I thought about them,
I... "Fuck them," you know?

I hated them. You know, "Scumbags."
There wasn't any...

It was always like resentment.

I was angry, I was hurt,
I was pissed off.

You know, I was full of self-pity.
It was all this shit I hadn't done, right?

"These little fuckers,"
you know what I mean?

Like, I didn't get to make...
I didn't even direct <i>Tommy,</i> you know?

<i>Kit told me his father died...</i>

<i>...at 45...</i>

<i>...and that he thought
he would die at 45 as well.</i>

<i>On my 45th birthday, um...</i>

<i>...I woke up in a detox.</i>

<i>Which I had gone to, right,
you know, specifically.</i>

<i>And I was 45.</i>

<i>So, um, you know...</i>

<i>...from that point on,
this idea of recovery...</i>

<i>...of being a sober guy, began.</i>

<i>It began.</i>

- Should we walk down to Kit's?
- Okay, fine. Fine, fine. Okay.

<i>There's someone in
the audience who is a really, really...</i>

<i>Man who's very special in my life...</i>

<i>...because The Who
would never have been...</i>

<i>...I'm sure, ever successful
without the help...</i>

<i>...of two special people.</i>

<i>In those days when we started,
we were a little band...</i>

...and two people joined us.

There was Kit Lambert
and there was Chris Stamp.

Sadly,
Kit isn't around anymore...

...but Chris Stamp is here tonight.

- And...
- Sit down so he can see you.

I love him dearly
and I've got to tell you...

...they were so important.

<i>They were the fifth and sixth
members of this band.</i>

<i>They formed the shell of the egg
that you know as The Who these days.</i>

<i>They guided us in every way.</i>

<i>And what Chris was really good at,
was he was the ideas man.</i>

<i>He was the juggler,
he was the magician saying:</i>

<i>"They can't just do an album.
We've gotta be on the ball.</i>

<i>We gotta do something
that's ahead of the curve."</i>

It was so lovely
to see you out there.

- Yeah, no, it was fucking great, man.
- It really was.

I was, like... You know,
I was near tears all the time.

You know what I mean?
Because I was full.

I'm not mentioning it,
but I loved all the shit you said about me.

- Ha-ha-ha. I don't want to...
- Really, mate?

- I don't want to appear... Yes, yes, yes!
- True.

And then, okay, I got sober. Right?

<i>I mean, and by the act of getting sober,
whatever that means...</i>

<i>What it meant for me was,
you know, I expanded somewhat...</i>

<i>...and started to sort of like,
own myself, for what I was, right?</i>

<i>You know, and that was just
a part of my life that was in the past.</i>

<i>I wasn't letting it
live in me now, you know.</i>

<i>I wasn't, like, festering over it.</i>

<i>And then Roger called me.</i>

Right? Roger called me.
I think Pete called me.

I don't think they called me
for any particular reason.

Roger was... Roger...

Roger, he had all sorts of ideas
that he wanted to talk to me about.

You know.

So we talked about the ideas, right?

<i>You know,
he made amends with his part.</i>

<i>I sort of said, well,
the same for me, you know?</i>

<i>I owned how I've left him behind.
It wasn't one-sided.</i>

<i>And the first idea that came up
between Roger and I...</i>

...was he wanted to make a film
about Keith Moon.

And that seemed a way
to move forward.

<i>It was a film,
it was another film, you know.</i>

<i>And so, we got a script organized.</i>

<i>We got it out to Hollywood, you know?</i>

<i>We raised money.</i>

<i>Well, The Who are being honored...</i>

<i>...it's called
the Kennedy Center Awards.</i>

<i>You're given an award...</i>

<i>...it's an outstanding contribution
to the arts and culture.</i>

You know, I can also say
that I was still happy they got it, right?

I was genuinely happy they got it.
I wasn't sort of like:

"Yeah the fuckers, they've sold out."
I didn't think like that.

<i>The invitation came
directly from Roger.</i>

<i>He was very gracious and very loving.</i>

You know, Roger has an understanding that
this group of people, alive and dead...

...you know, where the centerpiece...

...is something bigger than all of us,
you know?

And Roger understands that
in a very, sort of, deep way.

And so he, with a lot of love
and a lot of graciousness...

...insisted that I come.

<i>And I was happy to accept, you know?</i>

<i>Because it's about something
we were all involved with.</i>

<i>I mean, Kit is dead,
Keith's dead, John's dead...</i>

<i>But overall, the people
who were here today...</i>

...the three of us here today, of
that era... And Bill Curbishley...

...who's been here since,
as the manager figure...

<i>...have been involved in this process.</i>

<i>Pete said something which I loved.</i>

<i>He said, "As I wrote on
what The Who performed for...</i>

<i>...the people who liked us
felt seen and heard." Right?</i>

He said, "Now that the fucking
privileged understand and like my lyrics...

...why the fuck
am I still writing them?"

<i>I didn't want my life to be like,
well, I didn't get to make</i> Tommy...

<i>...I didn't get to make The Who film,
and I'm not making the Keith Moon film.</i>

Right? So perhaps
I shouldn't be making fucking films.

You know,
perhaps that's not in the picture.

<i>You know, I mean,
it was obviously not working, right?</i>

<i>I hadn't pulled one out of the bag.</i>

I hadn't directed
this fucking great masterpiece...

...that I'd been carrying around me
since I'm like 16 or whatever it was.

Isn't that wild? The White House.

<i>A lot of things we could've done,
and should have done, and didn't do...</i>

...but we, you know, we did enough.
You know, we spurred each other on.

We were sort of, like...
You know, we were loving, man.

We were loving to each other,
you know?

It's very difficult to,
sort of, know, you know...

...the moments that you love someone
a lot of the time.

<i>Yeah, love is giving.</i>

<i>Get a bit of love in your life,
you could give a little bit, right?</i>

<i>It's called intimacy, you know, and all...</i>

We want to naturally back off
from all that shit, right?

And Kit Lambert, Chris Stamp,
Pete Townshend...

...Roger Daltrey,
Keith Moon and John Entwistle...

...didn't quite back off
for a long period of time, you know?

We all thought we were sort of
keeping our so-called "individual cool"...

...but we weren't, you know?

We were there for each other...

...you know, in an un-heroic way...

...in a sensitive, frightening way.

Sensitive and frightening.

Just gonna pull your jacket so...

It's about to roll out.

- Is that the end of the roll?
- Yeah.

That's the end of the night then.
