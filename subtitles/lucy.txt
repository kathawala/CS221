<i>Life was given to us
a billion years ago.</i>

<i>What have we done
with it?</i>

Lucy?

It's as easy as pie.
In and out, all done and tested.

Then why don't do it yourself?

Milan said the guy is expecting a total '10' turning up to deliver the case.

You'll blow his mind. Come on.

What's in it?

Sweetheart...

Don't get paranoid on me, alright?
You trust me, don't you?

Richard, I really do like you
but...

I've to take care of myself right now, I got a...

I don't know, I gotta concentrate on so many things.

Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

I'm going home because I have exams on Monday.

I have to shower and
I have to study, OK?

You know what? The other day I was in this museum and you know what I found out?

What?

The first ever woman was named Lucy.

<i> Lucy </i>

Is that suppose to make me feel better?

Yeah...

- No.
- I'll call you, OK?

OK! OK! OK!

I'll be honest with you. I can't deliver the case myself.

I've a little falling out with the guy. It's nothing major...

but if it's you, problem solved.

You walk in there, you go up to the reception,

you ask Mr. Jang to come down.

He comes down, he takes the case, you flash your prettiest smile and bounce.

Look, you can even see the reception from here.

Come on.

- What's in the case?
- I don't know, it's just some paperwork.

- Yeah? I want to see it then.
- It's locked

and no one else but Mr. Jang has the code.

I'm just the delivery boy.

- Do you get paid to do this?
- Yeah, kinda.

Like how much?

OK, we're negotiating now or ...?

No, no, how much you get paid?
I want to know, how much?

A thousand dollars.

You get paid a thousand dollars for delivering  paperwork, really?

I don't know, it takes me 10 minutes and they're paying a grand and the rest is none of my business.

Wow, it's not my business either. I'm turning around...

- Listen!
- What?

Let's split it then.

That's 500 for you
and 500 for me.

- Richard, I'll call you.
- Listen! It is the third time this week.

I'm showing up at the same hotel with the same cowboy hat.

Problem solved.

- Go! Go! I'll wait for you. Go!
- Lucy, honey,

I...I've done this a thousand times.

It's paperwork! It's probably just some ??? they switched so they can copy them.

That's how it works in this country.

Even my Stetson was made here. Look!

It says so on the label:
<i>"Made in Taiwan"</i>

So long, cowboy, with a fake Stetson.

Baby, please!

Richard, I gotta go.

- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

- What the hell are you do...?
- I'm so sorry. I really need your help.

Stop it! Stop it! Take this off me, right now!

- I can't!
- Take this off me, right now!

- I can't! Mr. Jang is the only one who has the key!
- No!

Just get in there and ask
to meet him at the reception.

No! Take it off me, right now!

I'm really sorry, I really have no choice.
The sooner you go in, the sooner you'll be back out.

I can't believe you did this to me.

- I'll be right here, you've my word.
- Your word isn't worth shit!

Uh...it's worth 500 bugs, upfront.

You're an asshole!

And you're wonderful, huh?

Miss, may I help you?

Yes.

I'm here for, uh...

Mr. Jang.

Yes.

Who should I say is here?

Richard.
Uh, Richard sent me.
Richard sent me.
Mr. Jang, (greeting).
There's a lady here asking for you.

What's your name?

No, Richard.
Richard, uh, he's just looking for a place to park.
She said she came with Richard.

Mr. Jang still wants to know your name.

Lucy.

Lucy what?

Just...just Lucy.
If he, could he...be quick 'cause I...I've to...
Just a second while I translate...
Mr. Jang, she said her name is Lucy.
That's all she told me. Alright.

Mr. Jang is on his way,
stay right here.

Can I sit?

En. Jang said you need to stay right here.
I think it's better if you stay right here.

Excuse me. Regent Hotel.

No!

No!

No, wait! No!

Please!

Wait, I don't know anything!

Please! Please! Let me...

No, please!

Do you speak English?

Tambien hablo poco Espanol.
( I speak a little Spanish too )

Lucy, yes, I'm Lucy.

It's just a terrible mistake.
I'm just suppose to deliver this case.

If you lost the key, you don't have to chop off my hand, you can just cut the chain, OK?

Please!

I'm begging you, please!

No! No! No!

No! No! Please!

Please!

Please!

<i>Hello, Miss, I speak English.
I translate for Mr. Jang.</i>

Please tell him that I haven't done anything.
I don't know anything.

It's all just a big mistake, OK?
Please, please tell him that.

<i>Yes, OK, OK, hold on.</i>

<i>Mr. Jang wants to know what's in the case.</i>

Well, I don't know what's in the case. Do you speak English or don't you speak English?!

<i>Yes, I do! I studied one year
at International High School in New York.</i>

OK.

Richard gave me the case to give to you,
that's all I know.

OK, please tell him that.

He gave me a paper with numbers written on it,
I don't know...what is this?

<i>It's the code to open the case.</i>

What's really in here?

<i>Nothing dangerous.</i>

So why won't he open it himself?

<i>He doesn't trust Mr. Richard.</i>

I don't trust Richard either.

I only dated him for a week.

OK! OK! OK!

<i>- Mr. Jang insists that you open the case.</i>
- OK! OK!

Please God, help me.

<i>He wants you to hurry up,
Mr. Jang has other things to do.</i>

<i>Can you describe the content of the case?</i>

It's 4 plastic pouches filled with blue powder like a...

or maybe a purple powder?
I don't know, it looks gross.

<i>Mr. Jang wants to offer you a job.</i>

A job?

I don't want a job!

<i>If life thrived approximately a billion years ago,</i>

<i>we'll have to wait 400,000 years</i>

<i>to see the end of race of the first nerve cells.</i>

This is where life we know it begins.

Brain formation of only a few miligrams

is not possible to determine
any sign of intelligence yet.

It acts more as a reflect.

One neuron, you're alive.
Two neurons, you're moving.

And with movement,
interesting things began to happen.

Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.

Yet, most specie only use 3-5%
of its celebral capacity.

But it's not until we reached human being at the top of the animal chain,

that we finally see a specie used
more of its celebral capacity.

it's a lot if we look at all we've done with it.

<i>Now let's discuss a special case.</i>

The only living being
that uses it's brain better than us...

...the dolphin.

<i>It's estimated that this incredible animal</i>

uses up to 20% of its
celebral capacity.

And in particular, this allows it to have an echo-location system

that's more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.

But the dolphin did not invent the sonar.
It developed it naturally.

And this is the crucial part of our

philosophical reflection we've today.

Can we therefore conclude

that humans are concerned more with

"having"...

...than "being".

Lucy.

what did you do with my stomach?

Nothing! Just a little horizontal slit. It's very well done

and you'll find in a month,
this scar is practically invisible.

You'll be in shape for the beach next summer.

I don't care about the scar.

Is it, uh...is it why we opened you up?

Rest assured, we didn't harvest your organ or anything

and we merely slipped a little package in your lower stomach.

It's a...it's a new drug the kids in Europe is gonna love, believe me.

- What's that?
- Well, the scientific term is CPH4.

It's not very sexy from a sale's point of view.

So, uh...we're...we're still working on something a little bit more popular.

Any suggestion?

Excuse me.

Welcome.

Welcome, come on in.
Lovely, oops...

Splendid! Splendid!

Marvelous! Lovely! Lovely!

- How are you?
- Very good, me dear.

OK.

Right, uh...first of all, many thanks for taking part in this enterprise

which I'm sure will go off flawlessly.

These lovely passport and tickets

will enable you to return home in the next 24 hours.

Now, upon arrival, you'll be taken in hand by our people

so that we might recover our merchadise

and you might re-discover the freedom which you so richly deserve.

So, I'm sure I needn't remind you but if any of those who may be attempted to

warn or turn themself in to the authorities,

we've the names and addresses of the famalies of everyone of you
down to the distant cousins.

So, we rely therefore, on your complete discretion.

Good, anyway, uh...

gentleman, ma'dam, allow me to be the first to wish you

"bon voyage"!

Oops!!!

You gonna sell this?

I'm afraid it's our business model.

<i>For primitive beings like us, life seems to only have one single purpose.</i>

<i>Gaining time.</i>

And its going thru' time,
seems to be also the only

real purpose of each of the cell in our bodies.

To achieve that aim, the mass of the cell

that make up earth worm and human beings

has only 2 solutions.

Be a mortal...

...or to reproduce.

If its habitat is not sufficiently favorable or nurturing,

the cell will choose immortality.

In another word, self-sufficiency and self-management.

On the other hand, if the habitat is favorable,

they will choose to reproduce.

That way, when they die,

they hand down essential information and knowledge to the next cell

which hands it down to the next cell and so on.

Thus, knowledge and learning

all handed down thru' time.

OK, OK, keep calm...

You do right, wait for time...

I'm trying to think it thru'... just take the flight,

take the flight, get out of here.

That's the main thing right now,
just keep calm,

don't try anything, keep your cool, you're alive...

you're alive, Amy, you're alive,
that's all that matters.

Just wait, stay calm,
stay calm.
<i>Quit fooling around!
I'm not in the mood.
The bitch had you!
Shit! It's bleeding!</i>

<i>Let's imagine for a few moments</i>

what our life would be like
if we could access, let's say,


This first stage would give us access to and control

of our own body.

- Sir.
- Yes?

Has it been proven scientifically?

Oh, for the moment, it's just hypothesis, I confess

but if you think about it,

it's troubling to realize that the Greeks, the Egyptians and the Indians

had notion of "cells" centuries before the invention of the microscope

and what to say about Darwin

whom everybody took for a fool when he put forward his Theory of Evolution.

It's up to us to push the rules and laws

and go from "evolution" to "revolution".


of which only 15% are activated.

There're more connections in the human body than there're stars in the galaxy.

<i>We possess a gigantic network of information</i>

to which we've almost no access.

- Sir!
- Yes?

And what would be the next stage?

Well, the next stage would probably be control of other people.

But for that, we will need to access at least 40% of our brains' capacity.

And after control of ourselves and others,

come control of matter.

But now we're entering the realm of science fiction.

And we don't know anything more than a dog who watches the moon.

- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

But what would happen if for some reason we ignore

somebody in ??? 100% of the celebral capacity?


Yes.

I've no idea.

Hey!

- Hey, you speak English?
- No, no, no.

- You speak English?
- Yes, yes.
- Take me to the hospital now.
- Hospital?
<i>My leg!</i>

- Hospital.
- Wait for me.

Miss, hello?

Hey, miss!

I need help, it's urgent.

You cannot be in here. We're operating.

Please, get out!

You wouldn't be able to save him anyway.

Tumour already invaded the cortext
and right side of his spine.

Somebody put a bag of drug in me.
I need you to remove it.

It's leaking.

Do it now.

Right. I'll just administer local anaethestic...

Don't bother.

Right, I...okay.

Calm down, please.
Put the gun down.

I'm just going to...examine, OK?

- Do you mind?
- No.

<i>- Hello ?</i>
- Mom ?

<i>Hey, Lucy.</i>

<i>Baby, it's great to hear from you</i>

<i>but what time is it over there?</i>

I don't know, it's night.

<i>Hold on a sec', let me get rid of the other line.</i>

I'm going to go inside.

<i>I'm back, you're not partying too much, are you?</i>

<i>You promised me you'll look after yourself.</i>

I'm trying to, mommy,
I'm trying to.

<i>Well, thanks for calling out of the blue like this.</i>

<i>Your father is gonna be sad he missed you.</i>

<i>He isn't home from the gym yet.
Usually you call us in the morning.</i>

- Mom...
<i>- Yes ?</i>

I feel everything.

<i>What do you mean, sweatie?</i>

Space,

the air,

the vibrations,

the people.

I can feel the gravity.

I can feel the rotation of the Earth.

The heat leaving my body,

the blood in my veins,

I can feel my brain.

The deepest parts of my memory.

<i>Sweatie, we've a bad connection,
I can't hear you so well.</i>

<i>What did you say about 'memory' ?</i>

The pain in my mouth, when I had braces, I...

...I can remember the feeling of your hand on my forehead when I ran a fever.

I remember stroking the cat, it was so soft.

<i>A cat? What cat, honey?</i>

Siamese with blue eye and a broken tail.

<i>Sweatie, you can't possibly remember that.</i>

<i>You were barely a year old.</i>

I remember the days of your milk in my mouth,

the room,

the liquid...

<i>Sweatie, what are you talking about?</i>

I just wanna tell you that I love you, mom and dad...

<i>Sweatie...</i>

And I wanna thank you for the...

thousand kisses that I can still feel on my face...

I love you, mom.

<i>I love you too, sweatie,</i>

<i>more than anything in the world.</i>

How much is left?


And how long will it take
for my body to eliminate the rest of it?

To answer that, I need to know what it is.

May I?

Go ahead.

CPH4.

Tell me about it.

Pregnant women manufacture CPH4
in the sixth week of pregnancy,

in tiny quantities.

For a baby, it packs the power of an atomic bomb.

It's what gives the foetus the necessary energy to form all the bones in its body.

I've heard they tried to make a synthetic version of it,

didn't realize that they succeeded.

If it really is CPH4,

in this quantity, I'm amaze you're still alive.

Not for long.

Learning is always a painful process.

Like when you're little, your bones are growing and you ached all over.

Can you believe I can remember the sound
of my own bones growing?

Like this "grinding" under the skin.

Everything is different now.

Like...sound of music that
I can understand, like fluids...

It's funny I used to be so concern with

who I was and what I wanted to be, and...

now I've access to the furthest reaches of my brain, I see things clearly and realize

what make us "us", it's primitive.

They're all obstacles.

Does that make any sense?

Like this pain you're experiencing...

...is blocking you from understanding.

All you know now is pain.

That's all you know, pain.

Where are the others?

The others carrying the drugs,
I need the rest of it,

for medicinal purposes.

Berlin.

Paris.

Rome.

Thank you for sharing.

- Oh, good evening, Professor.
- I sweared I'll be back.

You hadn't forget your dinner tonight?

I'm afraid so, I'm exhausted.

- Have a good rest.
- Thank you.

You scared the shit out of me, felt like some nut bar!

I miss you!

Me too.

You lose your key or something?

Yeah.

- Can I borrow your laptop?
- Yeah, of course.

So I spend all day at this audition, awesome.

They just have you standing around all day because they don't give a shit about your time, gabbing away in Chinese.

Who understand Chinese?
I don't understand Chinese.

And then they say they always gonna call

and they never do.
They don't even take your phone number.

You know, except this one guy,
I bet he, uh...he's not Chinese.

He works at the agency and he's cute...
Oh my God, he's cute!

You know, like, the cute in kinda way,
like he has this thing...

Oh my God, his arse...

Let me get started on that!

And you'll never gonna guess where he take me.

Four Seasons, Royal Suite, and we made love all night.

I'm sorry, I'm talking about myself.
What's up? How's Richard?

He's dead.

You guys are crazy.
I'm gonna take a shower.

- Yes?
<i>- Profesor Norman, my name is Lucy.</i>

<i>I've just read all your research on the human's brain. We need to meet.</i>

All of my research?

Well, I'm very flattered, young lady but I find that hard to believe.

I must have written no less than...

<i>6.734 pages, I can recite them too
all by heart if you wish.</i>

Are you one of Emily's friends?

This sounds like one of her silly jokes.
Is she there with you?

<i>No, I'm on my own.</i>

- Who are you?
<i>- I just told you.</i>

Lucy, right? Yes, sorry.

<i>I read your theory on the use of the brain's capacity.</i>

<i>It's a little rudimentary but you're on the right track.</i>

Oh, thank you.

<i>Professor, my cells are reproducing at a phenomenal speed,</i>

<i>several millions per second</i>

and I'm having trouble precisely evaluating the time of my death

but I doubt it'll last more than 24 hours.

What are you talking about?

<i>What I'm saying is that your theory is not a theory.</i>

<i>I absorbed a large quatity of synthetic CPH4</i>

that would allow me to use 100% of my celebral capacity.

<i>Right now I'm at 28 %
and which you wrote is true.</i>

<i>Once the brain reaches 20% ,
it opens up and expands the rest</i>

<i>and there are no more obstacles.</i>

<i>They fall away like dominos. I'm colonizing my own brain.</i>

Uh...well...I don't know...what to...say.

It's true, I've...I've been working on this theory for over 20 years but it's...

it's only...all ever been hypothesis and research ideas.

I...I never thought anyone would...

You can control your own metabolism?

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>And I can start to control other people's bodies.</i>

<i>Also I can control magnetic and electric waves and...</i>

<i>not all of them, just...the most basic.</i>

<i>Television.</i>

<i>Telephone.</i>

<i>Radio.</i>

It's amazing.

<i>I don't feel pain,</i>

<i>fear,</i>

<i>desire,</i>

<i>it's like all things
that make us human are fading away.</i>

<i>It's like the less human I feel,</i>

<i>all these knowledge about...everything,</i>

<i>Quantum Physics, Applied Mathemathics,</i>

<i>the infinite capacity of the cell's nucleus,</i>

<i>they're all exploding inside my brain,
all these knowledge...</i>

<i>I don't know what to do with it.</i>

If you're asking me...what to do...

You know...

if you think about

the very nature of life...

I mean, from the very begining...

The development of the first cell...divided into two cells.

This whole purpose of life has been

passed on what was learned.

There's no higher purpose.

So if you're asking me what to do with all these knowledge you're accumalating, I'd say...

pass it on,

just like any simple cell,

going thru' time.

<i>Time?</i>

<i>Yes, of course.</i>

<i>I'll be at your door in  12 hours.</i>

- You leaving?
- Yes.

- What is this?
- A prescription.

Since when did you start writing Chinese?

- Since an hour ago.
- Lucy, I don't understand any of this.

Your kidneys aren't functioning efficiently, your liver is failing, you need to make some lifestyle changes.

Take this medication, work out, eat organic,

you'll be OK.

<i>Last night, at 11 pm, a woman shot a patient dead.</i>

<i>It happened at Tri-Service Hospital.</i>

<i>The suspect is 25, blonde, medium height.</i>

<i>Police are hunting nationwide.</i>

<i>She is armed and dangerous.</i>

Del Rio.

<i>I got a weird call from a US citizen in Taiwan.</i>

<i>A young woman calling to tip us off a big drugs ring.</i>

<i>- I'll take it.
- OK, she's yours.</i>

<i>- Hello ?</i>
- Yes, I've important imformation about a group of drug traffickers.

I need to speak with someone in position of authority.

Ah-hah, you're very lucky. There's no one with more authority in this office than me.

But let's start with the begining.
What's your name?

Listen up, Pierre Del Rio, get off your desk, sit in your chair,

<i>pick up the red pen to your left and
take down everything I say.</i>

There're no cameras, hurry up.
I've no time to waste.

Go ahead.

I'm gonna be sending you details of three people about to arrive in Europe.

Each one is carrying a kilo of drugs. I need you to arrest them and collect the substance.

I'll need it later.

What form of these drugs in? Bars? Capsules?

Powder, hidden in plastic pouches inside their intestines.

Excuse me?

Make sure to be careful when you remove them.
The product is very powerful.

Believe me.

<i>Got it?</i>

Yeah.

Good.

I'm counting on you.

Okay?

Good morning.

Berlin - Germany

Thank you.

That's him! Pick him up!

Come with me, please.

Hello.

Sir, come with me.

Welcome to Rome.

Good morning, sir.

Please, follow me. This way.

Yeah, sure.

Del Rio.

Thanks for calling me back.

We got the third guy.

Thanks very much. I'll send you the paper work with the transfer.

Bye.

Okay, we got all three.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're now begining our descend to Paris-Charles de Gaulle</i>

Miss, I've to ask you to put away your computer now.

You should wipe your nose.

- Excuse me?
- May I have a glass of champagne?

Um, yes, of course.

Miss, your champagne.

Thank you.

I'm very sorry but...uh,
you really need to close your table now.

Sure.

To knowledge.

<i>If the habitat is
not sufficiently favorable or nurturing...</i>

<i>the cell will choose immortality.</i>

<i>In another word, self-sufficiency
and self-management.</i>

No, miss, miss.

You must remain seated.

Miss, stop!

Miss...

Miss, open the door!
You really have to go back to your seat! Miss!

We're going to land soon,
please, open the door!

Please, say something,
are you okay?

Miss?

Miss!

Miss, please open the door!

Do something, help me open!

Answer me! Open the door!

Miss? Are you okay?
Say something!

<i>With a scar on her lower abdomen?</i>

Yeah, we got it out of her.

- How is she?
- Fine, she's doing fine.

With the shot I gave her,
she should wake up in a day.

- Doctor, she's awake.
- Are you sure?

Yes, she's sitting on the bed.

That's her.

- You didn't restrain her?
- Sure we did!

Miss, don't move!

- I need to talk to you alone.
- And I need you to put your hands up, please.

Did you get the packets?

Yes.

- Where're they?
- They're safe.

Here, in Paris.

They'll be safer in my hands.

Don't leave the car there.
Park it up.

You know, as a cop, we see some pretty weird shit

but I've to be honest with you.

What you did back there,
that freaked me out.

To put everyone to sleep like that,

do I need to be worried?

No.

Good.

Do you mind?

No.

- What's that?
- Korean, I'm going to drive.

Hey! Hey! Hey! No! No! No!
This is a police car!

You can't! No, this is not possible, lady.

This is a police car!

OK, OK.

Let's go, guys!

Sir, sir, excuse me, sir.

I need to talk to somebody.

Talk to the police.

Look, I'm a German citizen
and I demand us a lawyer.

I'll check the surgery.

- Grab us some food.
- You're a foodaholic.

Do you always drive like that?

I never driven before.

Great.

- Hey, this is one way!
- We're late.

Hey, I would rather be late than dead.

We never really die.

Sorry, sir, I don't agree...

I'm fine, fine.

I'm going to tell them to stop following us.

Don't bother.

Hey, I got you backup...

Give me the case.

Kill her and get the pouch.

Don't stand there, kill her!

Open it.

Let's go.

I'm not sure I could be of any help for you.

Yes, you are.

What for?

A reminder.

Shall we go?
Where are we going?
<i>Take the first left</i>

Okay.

Follow that car.

- Professor?
- Thanks.

- Yes?
<i>- Lucy.</i>

It's her, it's her.

Hey you, you're in Paris?

<i>Yes, I'm.</i>

Good, good, excellant.

So, look, I'm no longer at the hotel now, uh,
I've come to the university

where I've taken the liberty of calling and gathering
a few of my colleagues to discuss your case.

Top men in their field
and um...very trustworthy.

<i>I trust you.</i>

Oh, thank you. So, do you think  you can
meet us here at the university?

I'm, uh...I'm very pleased to meet you.

Likewise.

- Captain Del Rio.
- How do you do?

Let...let me introduce you to my colleagues.

This is Professor Cartier,  neuro surgeon.

- Professor...
- I know who everyone is.

Ah, of course.

Uh, gentlemen, this is Lucy,
the first woman to...

I mean...like I mentioned earlier...

Ms. Lucy has for reasons, remains a mystery to me,

unlocked certain portion of her brain

that offered access

to...previously unexplored celebral zones.

She has abilities.

Can you give us an example?

Your daughter, Gabriel, aged 6,
died in a car accident.

It was a blue car, leather seats...

<i>plastic bird hanging from the rear view mirror.</i>

Boss, 5 men down at the hospital. Sorry.

How many men left?

I've about 25 men with me.

That damn girl, she doesn't give in. She's a witch.

I know that.

I'll kill her myself.

There're men coming here,
can you secure the room?

- I need to stay focus.
- Sure.

Speed it up.

How did you manage to access all these information?

Electrical impulses...

Every cell knows and talks to every other cell.

They exchange a thousand bits of information between them per second.

Cells group together, forming a giant web of communication

which in turn forms matter.

Cells get together,
take on one form,

deform, reform,

makes no difference, it's all the same.

<i>Human considers themself unique.</i>

<i>So, they rooted their whole theory of existence on their uniqueness.</i>

'One'...is the unit of measure but it's not.

All social systems we put into place are mere 'sketch'.

That's all we learned.

But 1 + 1 has never equalled 2.

They're in fact, no numbers and no letters.

We codify our existence
to bring it down to haman size

to make it comprehensible.

We created the scale so that we can forget its unfathomable scale.

<i>But if humans are not the unit of measure,</i>

<i>and the world isn't governed by mathemathical laws,</i>

what governs all that?

Form a car speeding down the road...

speed up the image infinitely

and the car disappears.

So, what proof do we have of its existence?

Time gives legitimacy to its existence.

Time is the only true unit of meassure.

<i>It gives proof to the existence of matter.</i>

Without time,

we don't exist.

Time is 'unity'.

Search the whole building and find her!

We wouldn't be able to hold them for much longer.

Time to go then.

Are you sure you need such huge doses?

I'm afraid you won't survive.

Some cells inside me will fight and defend their integrity to the very end.

In order to attain the last few percent, I've to force it.

To crack the cells open to their nucleus.

All these knowledge, Lucy...

I'm not even sure that
mankind is ready for it.

We're so driven by power and profit.

Given man's nature,

it might bring us only instability and chaos.

Ignorance brings chaos,
not knowledge.

I'll build a computer
and download all my knowledge in it.

I'll find a way for you
to have access to it.

Yeah.

I just hope, we'll be worthy of your sacrifice.

Nobody move!

Do you understand English?

What is she doing?

She's looking for energy and matter.

And she's trying to connect with our computers.

Chong-Ju!

I'm here, boss!

Do something about them.

Okay, boss!

You guys, come on.

Ready?

You okay?

Get a medic, fast!

Oh my God, what's happening?

What's she making?

A new generation of computer, I presume.

Where is she?

Where is she?

Answer me!

Answer me!

Hey, you!

Look, the computer, it's moving.

Hey.

Where is she?

<i>I am everywhere</i>

<i> Life was given to us
a billion years ago. </i>

<i>Now you know what to do with it.</i>
