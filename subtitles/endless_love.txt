DAVID: There was a girl.

A beautiful girl
surrounded by people.

Yet utterly alone.

Her brother, Chris,
died sophomore year.

She spent all of her time
secluded with her family,

or in the comfort of books.

I watched her for
all of high school,

waiting for that perfect
moment to talk to her,

but that moment never came.

(INAUDIBLE)

I watched as people
gradually forgot about her.

And she seemed content
to disappear.

But not to me.

And although she didn't know it,

I saw the possibility of us.

Jade Butterfield. Mmm.

Four years, and yöu
never talked to her.

Well, in my defense, no one did.

There is a reason for that.
She's an ice queen.

Girl can't be real.

yöu don't think she's real?

"yöu don't think..."

Girl looks like that, has that much
dough, can't be real, all right?

I know these things.

(CHUCKLES)

Ah, it's stupid, I know.

No, it's not.

Come on. Dad wants a photo
of the happy family.

Oh, whose family are we
taking a picture of?

Come on.

Jade, come take a picture.

- Me?
- Yeah, yöu.

Okay.

Thank yöu so much.
Will yöu take two?

Just to be safe.

Okay.

(SHUTTER CLICKING)

- There.
- Thank yöu.

- Congrats, honey.
- Thanks.

GIRL 1: That one's going online.

GIRL 2: Yeah.

I barely know those girls.

I didn't expect to
be in the picture.

Take a seat. Come on.

Mom and Dad's happy
family photo can wait.

(CHUCKLES)

Promise me yöu won't do in
college what yöu did here.

Chris was an amazing brother,
and we all miss him,

but yöu can't stop living.

He'd want us to live
more, not less.

How's anyone ever gonna know how
ridiculous and funny yöu are

if all yöu ever do is hang
out with Mom and Dad?

- I don't just hang out with Mom and Dad.
- Oh, really?

How many kids signed this?

And, uh, yöu can't
include teachers.

Don't.

Thanks, Dad.

yöu're welcome, son.
I'm proud of yöu.

Thank yöu. It means a lot.

Maybe yöu should buy
a blowtorch, huh?

- To melt the ice off yöur girl.
- Mace...

- yöur son's got a crush.
- No, I don't.

- Does he?
- No, I don't.

- Is she here?
- Yeah.

Which one is it?

- Jade Butterfield. Mmm..hmm.
- HARRY: That blonde over there?

- Don't yöu dare. No.
- Hey, Jade!

Hey, Jade!

MACE: Jade!

Jade, I want yöu to meet my son!

- Come on! Come on!
- The greatest kid here!

DAVID: Hey, yöu guys. Come on, man!

Whoo..hoo. My son, the
high school graduate!

(GROANING)

Oh, wow. Mr. Schwartz,
thank yöu. This is too much.

Mrs. Schwartz. yöu guys take
care now, all right? Okay.

Ah. (CHUCKLES)

Balling!

Dude, yöu going to
Jenny's Saturday night?

Really? Again?

- Come on.
- Don't do this.

Do yöu have any idea how yöur
constant break ups affect my life?

I'm so sorry.

The energy, man, it gets all
awkward and shit, all right?

Just get back together
with her so I can

go back to the life
I'm accustomed to.

Can yöu act like a
respectable human being?

yöu're the first
face the guests see.

And yet they keep coming back.
(CHUCKLES)

Welcome to the Inn.
How are yöu doing?

HUGH: Can yöu just, uh,
give me a nice spot?

MACE: Absolutely.
Will do, sir. Take care.

(CHUCKLES)

yöu're Jade Butterfield.

(CHUCKLES)

We go to school... I mean,

we went to school together.

David, right?

Yeah.

HUGH: Hey, Jade.

I should go.

Okay.

Would yöu sign this?

Sure.

MACE: Jade Butterfield

Come back to me

I'm David and I love yöu

(CHUCKLES)

HUGH: My wife will have a mixed salad
to start and yöur pasta special.

My daughter's gonna have the
steak, medium, and soup to start.

Good?

- Yeah.
- WAITER: And for yöu?

I think I can handle this myself.

I'm gonna go for the burger and
fries. Medium rare, please.

And a Crown and Coke. Better
make it a double, actually.

yöu're here from ASU
for two short months.

Let's just try and
keep it pleasant.

That's why I got the double, Dad.

Um...

We've been going back and forth over
what to get yöu for graduation.

We know we haven't done very
well with the holidays and so on

and that's not been
fair to yöu or Keith.

I don't need anything.

We could go shopping. We could
get a new wardrobe for Brown.

Yeah, yöu should
think of something,

or else yöu'll end up
with a photo of this guy.

(ALL CHUCKLE)

There is one thing.

What? Anything.

- A party.
- A party? Wow.

Out of all the things
yöu could ask for?

Well, I was looking at all
the kids at school today

and high school's where yöu're supposed
to make friends yöu'll keep forever.

I don't know any of them.

They don't know me.

A party. I think that
that is a great idea.

Well...

Sure.

- Yeah, sure. Okay.
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

HUGH: It's been a long time since
we've celebrated anything.

Thank yöu very much, Mr. Abbey.

(CHUCKLES)

- Hi.
- Hi.

Do yöu want me to get yöur car?

No. Um...

I'm having a graduation party.

(CHUCKLES)

- I'm inviting the entire class.
- Really?

Is it that hard to believe?

Uh, no. I've just
never seen yöu out.

I didn't know that yöu, uh...

- Mingled with the masses.
- (CHUCKLES)

I just spent the last
four years of high school

trying to get into another
four years of college.

(CHUCKLING)

- yöu don't have to come.
- No, I want to.

(STAMMERING) I mean, we want to.

- We wanna come.
- We wanna come.

(ENGINE REVVING)

Could yöu just give me one second?

- MACE: Welcome.
- Welcome to the Inn.

Keep it close. Don't park me in.

- Oh, sure, no...
- (COINS CLATTER)

No, he didn't. Hey, man.

Now, I'll take them, but yöu gotta
hand them to me, all right?

I don't pick up shit off the floor.

It's time to learn.

- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- (CHUCKLES)

yöu boys best earn yöur
three minutes in my car.

- Yeah, thanks, man.
- MACE: "Boys"?

DAVID: Give me the keys. Come on.

Give me the keys.

I guess we should definitely earn
our three minutes, don't yöu think?

Why limit ourselves to three?

I mean, why?

- Are yöu coming?
- yöu're stealing his car?

- Whoa.
- I mean, I wouldn't say "stealing."

Technically, borrowing.

What about yöur job?

Jade, get in the car.
Jade, get in the car.

- What?
- (ENGINE STARTS)

Get in the car.

- What is she doing?
- I don't know. Come on!

MACE: Get in the car!

Jade Butterfield, get in
the car this instant.

- (TIRES SCREECHING)
- (MUSIC PLAYING)

Whoo..hoo!

(SQUEALS)

Whoo!

Yeah!

(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

Yeah!

(BOTH CHEERING)

(ENGINE REVVING)

Where the hell have yöu been?

We've got guests freaking out.

- yöu stole my car.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

Sorry. We just wanted to make
sure it wasn't parked in.

yöu ate Fatburger in my Maserati.

It's over. yöu're done, mister.

That's actually my fault.
yöu should blame me.

All right, I want him fired.

- Now.
- No, it was my...

- I want him fired, too.
- It was my fault!

- Him and him fired, and I'm having yöur job.
- I ate Fatburger!

It was me. It was me. I ate it.

No. It was me.

- I ate the Fatburger.
- (ALL SNICKERING)

(CHUCKLING)

- Oh, is this a joke to yöu?
- No, I mean...

yöu trying to impress yöur hot
little girlfriend over there?

Now, watch what yöu're saying.

Everyone, cool down.

Why don't we go inside?

It's gonna take a lot
more than stealing

my car to get her
to spread her legs.

MACE: Oh, shit. Damn!

- That was self defense.
- Get out of here, David! Now!

- MACE: What was that?
- That kid, he hit me!

Jade. Are yöu all right?

MAN: I swear to God, I'll sue.

That was self defense.

MAN: God, I'll sue him.

I'll sue him, I'll sue yöu. I'll sue
everybody! I'll sue this whole place!

He's out of here, sir.

Is my Fatburger evidence?

'Cause I'd like to
finish eating it.

- Just get out of here, Mace.
- All right, yep.

- Sorry, sir. Sorry.
- (WHIRRING)

HARRY:
I hope this isn't happening again.

'Cause Judge Dean called.

Word travels fast.

It was no big deal.

I lost it for one sec, that's it.

Well, one second is
all it's gonna take

and I don't wanna have to
worry about yöu again, David.

Now, why would I wanna be a valet
when I can be here with yöu?

Plus, I am gonna own the
shop one day, right?

Ah, easy.
I'm still breathing, partner.

Right.

- This guy deserve it?
- Yeah.

Let me guess, yöu
were protecting Mace.

(CHUCKLES)

And a girl, too.

(INAUDIBLE)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

- No, no, no. Come on, come on.
- (CHUCKLES)

Answer it.

- Go on. Go, go, go.
- I'm going.

There she is!

- Congratulations, sweetheart!
- Thank yöu.

- Oh, my God, yöu look gorgeous tonight.
- Thank yöu.

yöur dad tells me that yöu'll be
leaving on yöur internship soon.

Two weeks. I'm really excited.

How exciting.

- Yeah, come in. I'll go get him.
- JOE: Thanks.

Dad?

Dad?

- Oh.
- There are people here.

I lost track of time.

Ah, okay.

(SIGHS)

Oh, yöu're beautiful.

Thank yöu.

Are yöu coming down?

Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

- See yöu, Dad.
- (MICROWAVE ALARM BEEPS)

yöu want me to heat yöu up a piece?

Ah, no, thanks. I'm on my way out.

Nice suit.

Got a job interview or something?


I did it already.

Yeah, that's why I'm redoing it.

yöu know, yöur mom
bought me this suit.

What for?

Get married in.

I can change if yöu want.

No, no, no.

Looks better on yöu.

This thing yöu're going to tonight,
is it a dance or something?

Mmm, sort of.

- Well, embarrass yöurself.
- (CHUCKLES)

- Builds character.
- Sure, sure.

DAWN: Hugh.

- Dawn, Joe, nice to see yöu.
- DAWN: Hi.

- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

Hi, Joe. Oh, yöu shouldn't have!

Since yöu did, how come only one?

(JOE CHUCKLES)

Raymond, Tracy, thanks for coming.

The Mayo Clinic's so
lucky to have yöu.

(INAUDIBLE)

Excuse me for a second.

This is what yöu wanted, right?

Yeah. It's great.

- Everything's great.
- JOE: Hugh!

Come over here and settle a bet.

Go.

A, uh, friend of yöurs is here.

WOMAN: Jade.

- Hi.
- Congratulations.

I'm so embarrassed. This isn't
exactly what I had in mind.

yöu run with a
slightly older crowd.

(CHUCKLING)

It's a complete failure.

I thought if I reached
out to our class,

they'd wanna be here as much
as I wanted them to, but...

There's another graduation party.

That's probably where everyone is.

Oh, right, yeah.

yöu know what?
I'm gonna be a little creative.

- (CLEARS THROAT)
- (LINE RINGING)

MALE OPERATOR:
Atlanta Police Department.

Hi, I'm calling about a very loud
party at 44 Seawall Road. Um...

And I've asked the next door neighbor,
Jenny, to turn down the music,

and it just seems to be
getting louder and louder.

And now... Oh, God!

There seems to be someone
pissing on my Mini Cooper.

I need this shut down
straightaway. Thank yöu.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Hi.

Is David here?

Yeah, he's inside. Come in.

- Shit. Is this yöur party?
- Yeah.

(CHUCKLING) It's about time!

- Hi.
- Come on.

Hey. Hi.

(MUMBLING)

Hi.

- Should I take off my shoes or something?
- No.

- No?
- Come in.

(CHUCKLES)

(MOUTHING) The ice has melted!

Come on.

(CHUCKLES)

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

Thanks for getting
everyone here, man.

Yeah, man. Ah, about that. Uh...

(WOMEN CHUCKLING)

- yöu invited Jenny?
- "Invite" is a strong word.

Come on, man.

Dude. She cheated,
she's sorry. Let it go.

yöu did ruin her party.

Oh, shit. She's coming.

Later.

Wow. (CHUCKLES)

yöu certainly got everyone
here, didn't yöu?

Maybe that's because the
cops busted my party.

See, I think what happened, my
neighbor, who's in Florida,

sensed that there was a party
happening and called the cops.

Now all my friends are at
Jade Butterfield's party.

A girl who acted like we
didn't exist in high school.

Does that make sense to yöu, David?

yöu have a party every weekend.

What difference does it make?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

What's going on now?
Who are these kids?

David made it all happen.
Isn't it wonderful?

Who's David?

He's the friend of Jade's.
He's there.

- That's the valet!
- What?

That's the kid I was telling
yöu about at the restaurant.

Jade is happy.
The party is a great idea.

- Hugh, please.
- (MUTTERING)

Hey! Quiet! Quiet!

Right. So, uh, we're all
having a great time,

and, uh, it's gonna get
even better because

I have a really good
game we're gonna play

where each couple has to
pick a song out of a hat

and yöu all have half an hour
to choreograph a routine. Okay?

Hey. What do yöu
mean "choreograph"?

It's fine. yöu'll love it. Uh...

My beautiful date, Sabine, please.

Our song is romantic and big

so we should probably do a
lot of figure skating moves.

- Figure skating?
- Mmm..hmm.

Show me.

Like this.

Wow.

- yöu don't wanna do this?
- Mmm..mmm.

- Not even a little bit?
- Mmm..mmm.

Will yöu give me yöur hand?

- No.
- Come on.

Really?

Give me yöur hand.

Come on.

I did it for my third grade
ballet recital.

It goes over really well.

(DOOR OPENS)

Ten more minutes.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Uh...

Is she running?

yöu're stalling, aren't yöu?

No.

I just like cars. I promise.

My dad's been trying to
fix the carburetor forever.

So far, no luck.

Is it his?

No.

It's my brother Chris'.

My mom wants to sell it.

It makes her sad, just
sitting in the driveway.

All right.

Maybe I am stalling. (CHUCKLES)

Maybe we should, uh,

(CHUCKLING)

- rehearse.
- (ALL CHEERING)

It takes a certain type of confidence to
dance in the footsteps of Salt-N-Pepa.

I mean, a very brave person.

But we have two brave souls
coming up to do just that.

Mace and Gwen. Come on.

- (ALL CHEERING)
- (MUSIC PLAYING)

Get hype!

- Get hype!
- Whoo!

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHUCKLES)

(CHEERING)

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHEERING)

(WHISTLING)

Thank yöu for this.

Now, someone named Jade
Butterfield and her new friend.

Give him a hand but not
yöur car keys. David!

MACE: Yeah, David!

I see yöu!

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(ALL CHEERING)

MACE: Oh, man! What is this?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

DAVID: Shh, follow me.

(JADE CHUCKLES)

Where are we going?

MAN: Whoo!

HUGH: All right, everyone,
calm down. It's just a blackout.

I've wanted to kiss yöu
since the 10th grade.

I couldn't go another minute
without telling yöu that.

All right!

All right!

First off, I'd like to
apologize for the power.

It seems even our home is objecting

- to the number of people here tonight.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

Ah, but, more importantly,
I wanna make a toast.

We're all here tonight because
of our daughter, Jade,

a girl that brings so
much light to our life,

and as yöu can tell, if there's
one thing we need, it's light.

So, uh, Jade, where are yöu?

Shit.

HUGH: Jade. Come on.

Maybe he'll give up.

Come on, Jade.

GIRL: Busted!

Oh, shit.

Come on.

Get up here.

I'm so lucky

to be yöur father.

And everything yöu've
worked so hard for...

MAN: She's working hard, all right.

It's all coming true.

So here's to Jade.

- ALL: To Jade.
- (CHUCKLES)

(GLASS SHATTERS)

Oh..oh.

GIRL: Seriously?

Okay. It's been quite an evening.

But all good things must
come to an end, so, uh...

And that would be the sign.

We'll get yöu cabs,
or, uh, Hulu, or...

- Uber.
- HUGH: Yeah, Uber.

Those of yöu who are driving,
please drive safely, but drive.

- Party's over.
- Party is over.

MACE: Deuces.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

yöu must be David.

Yes, sir. Uh, it's
nice to meet yöu.

Can I show yöu out?

Sure.

I hear yöu're trying to get
yöur car running again.

Are yöu gonna steal it if I do?

(CHUCKLES)

Right, the valet.

No, that was just a
one time thing, I promise.

Did yöu have a good night tonight?

Well, let's just say I
prefer how it started.

yöu know, I really respect
yöur daughter, sir.

And the truth is, I just
wanted to make her happy.

I think she's amazing.

Good night.

It was a fun party, huh?

I'm just going to my room.

I have to go.

(HORN HONKING)

(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

(WHOOPING)

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

- Hi.
- Hi.

Last bay over there.

- Thanks.
- Yeah.

Hi.

- Oh.
- Whoa.

Are yöu okay?

(CHUCKLES) Not cool.

I got yöur text.

I was trying to think of things
I could do for yöur dad,

seeing as I feel like he didn't
love the closet as much as I did.

yöu don't need to do that, David.

I do.

I got something in
the box over there.

HUGH: Jade.

Sorry.

So, I spoke with Dr. Fitzgerald.

- Mmm..hmm.
- And we set a breakfast

for the morning yöu start.

yöu know, just so yöu can spend
that little extra time with her.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

And the dorm's all arranged?

I move in not this
Sunday, but next.

(CHUCKLES)

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

(ENGINE TURNS OFF)

(ENGINE STARTS)

What are yöu doing here?

- Get away from that car.
- Stop.

Look, it's working.

It was the old carburetor.
It was shot.

I had the right one
laying around the shop,

so I thought yöu might
wanna hear her run again.

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

That's amazing! What did yöu do?

- It's no big deal.
- JADE: Thank yöu.

I never thought I'd
hear that sound again.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Look, Jade told me how much
this car meant to yöu.

And I tried to rack my brain
around something I could do,

seeing as, yöu know, we got off on
the wrong foot the other night.

The other night.

(CHUCKLING)

When yöu emerged from a
closet with my daughter.

Dad, he did this for us.

ANNE:
It's a very kind gesture, David.

Would yöu maybe, um,
join us for dinner?

I wasn't looking for an invite.

I should go home and shower.

yöu could wash up here.
I have to get changed.

I don't wanna intrude.

No, yöu wouldn't be
intruding, honestly.

Dad, please.

Yeah, okay. Sure, sure, yeah.

- ANNE: Great.
- Come on.

yöu might not know this, David,

but, uh, Jade is following
in her father's footsteps,

enrolling pre med in the fall.

And since I'm kind of hoping
for a specialty in cardiology,

I just thought there was no better way to
celebrate than with a family heirloom.

No more gifts, Dad.
yöu've gotten me enough.

It was yöur grandfather's.

It was mine.

And it was gonna be Chris',
and now it's yöurs.

(JADE GASPS)

Oh, it's too much. Thank yöu.

Well, I think pre med
at Brown earns it.

Not to mention yöur internship
with Dr. Fitzgerald.

Internship? yöu never
mentioned that.

It's not a big deal, that's why.

Very big deal.

I mean, she'll be leaving and
spending, I don't know, most of...

Um, I, uh, had to
declare my major, too.

It's not as fancy as Jade's, but I
had to major in something, so...

Communications.

Communications.

Always wondered what that meant.

It's the study of
how we communicate.

Well, yöu know, yöu can always change
it later if it doesn't make sense.

All right, David. yöur turn.

Ah, here it comes, the inquisition.

(CHUCKLES)

It's okay. If I can
pass, yöu can pass.

Keith, did she pass? He still
doesn't call yöu his girlfriend.

Okay, David, look, we know yöur
act of generosity with the car

wasn't really about anything
other than my daughter, so...

(LAUGHING)

I'd just love to know a
little more about yöu,

other than the fact yöu
can fix an old car.

I'm sure that's not yöur
most noteworthy quality.

I mean, it might be.

What about yöur future plans?
Where are yöu going to college?

Uh, I'm not going to college.

- Oh.
- Mmm.

Don't feel yöu need it?

No, I'm not saying that.
I took my SATs.

Well, I mean...

No, I wouldn't let
that discourage yöu.

I mean, not everybody tests well.

Ah, I got a 2090.

(LAUGHING) Well done.

SABINE:
That's an amazing score, David.

yöu could get into
UGA with that score.

Maybe. But I like working
in my dad's shop.

And so does he.

And there's nothing
wrong with that.

Yeah, I don't need much.

Warm bed, clean socks,
milk in the fridge.

- A nice girl to come home to.
- (HUGH CHUCKLES)

Modern day romantic. I see.

- Can I just give yöu a piece of advice?
- Oh, no, Hugh.

Speaking as someone who's been
married for over two decades.

I mean, love is wonderful,
but it's not all yöu need.

yöu also need things
like life insurance

and PPOs and unromantic
things, like mortgages.

I get that.

I mean, I'm sure
I'll have all those things one day,

but I do think
that love comes first, yöu know?

At the end of the day,
what's more important than that?

KEITH: Oxygen.

Shut up, Keith.

(CHUCKLES)

yöu know, I've seen it firsthand.

I know what it's like
when it's there,

and I know what it's
like when it's not.

So yöu've been in love before.

No, no. (CHUCKLES)

But my parents were.

They met when they were in high
school, and it made sense.

That's what I wanna find.
True love.

The kind that yöu fight for,
that yöu always put first.

That makes yöu wanna
be good and do better.

And not just with any girl.

But "the" girl.

And when I find that,

that's all I need.

HUGH: Homeless and in love.

Sounds great.

Maybe I should have said
I was going to college.

- (CHUCKLING)
- Yeah.

I hope that yöu find that, David.

Thank yöu.
I mean, yöu and Hugh did.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

To love.

(ANNE CHUCKLES)

HUGH: Yes, to love.

- To love.
- DAVID: To love.

- JADE: To love.
- (GLASSES CLINKING)

I found what yöu said inspiring.

And inspiration has been in
short supply these days.

Uh, Jade tells me yöu're a writer.

Oh, I was a writer.

I wrote one book, but then, um,
life got in the way, so...

I've never met an author before.

If I got one of yöur books,
would yöu sign it for me?

(CHUCKLING)

Sure.

- Thanks. (CHUCKLES)
- Thank yöu.

Good night, David.

Thank yöu, sir.

- Good night.
- ANNE: Good night.

(CHUCKLES)

JADE: David!

(CHUCKLES)

She's leaving in two weeks. What
do yöu think he wants with her?

He's falling in love with her.

Well, she's not ready for that.

(CHUCKLES) Of course she is.
She's 17. It's her time.

She's never expressed any interest.

Oh, yöu haven't exactly let her.

So what should I do?

I should just encourage her to fall
in love and have her heart broken?

Yes, yöu should.

I think she'd be great at it.

I was.

Don't make this about us.

(FLOOR CREAKS)

Careful.

(SHUSHING)

yöu're shaking.

Good shaking.

We don't have to do this.

As much as I want to,

I can wait.

I don't wanna wait.

I wanna feel this with yöu.

Fast.

(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

Who are yöu texting?

That's unbelievably rude,
after what we just did.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

(CHUCKLES)

(JADE CHUCKLES)

So...

Don't yöu have to be at
yöur dad's shop soon?

I should probably go
before everyone wakes up.

(CHUCKLES)

It's mine now.
yöur first present to me.

(CHUCKLES)

I remember him.

yöu do?

Yeah.

We were in seventh grade
when he was a senior.

(CHUCKLES)

He was good. I remember that.

He was good.

What's it like to have lost him?

My dad, he saved us all.

After Chris got cancer, he stopped
working to take care of him.

We wouldn't have got
through it without him.

And we're doing so
much better, really.

I'm lucky that way.

Some families never heal,
and we're doing so well.

It's okay if none of that is true.

But it is.

I know. I'm just saying
it's okay if it's not.

(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

JADE: Enlarged ventricles.

Cardiomegaly.

Course of treatment?

Check the patient's kidneys.
Could be in renal failure.

That's good.

So yöu can stay for
the next surgery.

I've got an angioplasty
starting at 2:00.

Oh. I actually have plans.

I'm sorry.

Does he know that this thing is gonna
be ending in a couple of weeks?

'Cause the kid at dinner last
night didn't really seem to know.

Of course he does.

I thought we had the summer.

I know, but it's too competitive.
I can't turn it down.

Say something.

I don't care.

I don't.

I don't care if we have 10
days, or one week or one day.

I want yöu to spend it with me.

(CHUCKLES)

And if I do?

(INHALES)

I promise yöu

they'll be the best

(CHUCKLES)

(GIRLS SCREAMING)

Have a snack!

(SCREAMING)

There's two more days.

yöu better have something
amazing planned.

Maybe.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(LAUGHING)

(CHEERING)

I love yöu, too.

(BEEPING)

I don't wanna leave.
Tell me to stay.

I want to, but...

I don't care about the internship.

I want to be with
yöu for the summer.

- yöu mean that?
- Yeah.

- Then stay.
- (CHUCKLES)

Stay.

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

- Stay.
- (CHUCKLING)

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Oh, yöu're home late.

I'm tired, Dad. Please.

Can I just ask yöu why
yöu're unpacking?

I called Dr. Fitzgerald.

I'm not taking the internship.

(EXHALES)

(SIGHS)

So David put yöu up to this?

No. It was my decision.

The internship is yöur
ticket into medical school.

It's not something yöu
can just walk away from.

I know. But I'm an
incoming freshman

and I have four years
to find another ticket.

I went out on a limb with
Dr. Fitzgerald for yöu.

I'm sorry. But I'm allowed
to change my mind.

So, this has nothing
to do with David?

No.

Then what's going on?

We used to talk.
This doesn't make sense.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

Maybe I do want more
time with David.

Honey.

- yöu must have felt this way once.
- (SIGHS)

With Mom?

Yeah. But we hadn't just
graduated high school.

I was through medical school by the
time yöur mom and I got serious.

That's not where I am.

- Well...
- I'm here now,

and I've never felt
this way about anyone.

I thought about it,
and I dreamt about it.

I just never thought it
would actually happen.

And now that it has,

I need more time.

(SIGHS)

yöu know, of all the reasons

to sacrifice something that
yöu've worked so hard for,

a boy.

It's very unlike yöu.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

What's going on?

Ah, we're going to the lake house.

Get dressed. yöur bathing
suit's still in the dryer.

For the weekend?

- Hi, Jade.
- Hi.

Um, I don't know.

Uh, pack enough for
a couple of weeks.

yöur sentence begins now.

Heard about the internship.

Nice to know I'm not the
only one disappointing Dad.

yöu didn't tell me we were
going to the lake house.

Well, I think we need it, Jade.

I think we need to spend
time together as a family.

I think we're drifting.

I don't wanna go! yöu know that!

I can't leave David now!

yöu're going to the lake
house with yöur family,

and I'm not gonna hear any
more complaints about it.

Get yöur stuff.

Hey, man. Where yöu been?

(CHUCKLES)

I was with Jade. Why, yöu miss me?

Sure, yeah. Most nights I've
been crying myself to sleep.

(CHUCKLES)

UGA?

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

I didn't know yöu were thinking
about going to college.

Uh, I wasn't until recently.

College boy.
Yeah, I could see that.

Think yöu got a shot?

Jade's mom's gonna write a
letter of recommendation.

Plus, she used to work there, so...

I'm still gonna work in the shop.

Oh...

I like the idea.

I was wondering how I'd
afford early retirement.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

ANNE: Wait, wait a minute.
I have the key.

Anyone wanna take a swim?

No, we're starving. I'm gonna
take Sabine into town.

Can we bring something back?

HUGH: No, I'm fine.

- Sense of humor? Jagermeister, maybe?
- (CHUCKLING)

Do yöu want anything?

No.

I'll take a swim with yöu.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

JADE: I'll get it.

- Hey.
- Thank God yöu're here.

- Hey.
- ANNE: Hey.

- These are for yöu.
- Thank yöu.

Thank yöu so much for having me.

yöu have a beautiful house.

- JADE: Amazing, isn't it?
- What are yöu doing here, David?

Uh, Jade invited me.

Keith invited Sabine. I don't
see what the problem is.

The problem is this is
meant to be a family trip.

I'm sorry, but inviting David
was never part of the plan.

(SIGHS)

He didn't know?

It's fine, David.

- The more the merrier.
- HUGH: No, it's not fine.

ANNE: Hugh, please.

Well, he's here now, and I
don't want him to leave.

Well, that's not up to yöu.

Actually, it is.

He's my guest and he's staying.

(EXHALES)

Jade just became a woman.

yöu didn't tell yöur dad?

He's never gonna forgive me now.

He'll get over it, I promise.

Now yöu have the perfect chance to
show him how wonderful yöu are.

What are yöu doing?

Come on. (CHUCKLES)

Come on!

Really?

Take it off.

Come on.

Hurry up!

- (SCREAMING)
- Whoo!

I don't even recognize her.

And yöu know, she would never
act this way before him.

I think she's right on track.

Giving up the internship
is right on track?

Didn't it ever worry yöu that
she wasn't out in the world

experiencing life?

She spent the past two years either by
our sides or with her nose in a book.

She deserves to have
fun this summer.

Well, she was mourning her brother.

yöu can't expect her to go to a
slumber party every weekend.

I know very well who
she was mourning.

She just lost her teenage years
and now she's finding them.

HUGH: Yeah, with a total stranger.

We don't know anything about him.

(SIGHS)

She is falling in love, Hugh.

When did yöu last see her
this happy? Hmm? When?

I don't know.

That's something yöu wanna end?

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

HUGH: (STAMMERING)
I gotta say something.

I need to apologize to David.

I might have overreacted
slightly when yöu arrived,

and, uh, I'm sorry.

Thank yöu.

So, maybe, clean slate?

Yeah, that would be great.

(ALL CHUCKLING)

Nice. Cheers.

Thanks, Dad.

ANNE: Aw, that was beautiful.

Berries, anyone?

Mom, David finished yöur book.

- I loved it.
- She's an amazing writer, right?

Yeah, maybe yöu'll feel
ready to write again soon.

- yöu should.
- Yeah, maybe.

yöu reminded me how
much I love reading

and how much more I need to do.

Well, yöu'll have more
books than yöu know

what to do with at the
University of Georgia.

yöu think I have a chance?

Of course. With yöur SATs?

And Mom's letter.
They love her there.

So, yöu're applying to college?

Yeah. Yeah.

Second semester. Hopefully.

DAWN: Knock, knock.

- Hi.
- ANNE: Oh.

I didn't know Dawn was here.

No, neither did I.

- HUGH: Hey.
- Hi.

- Hi.
- HUGH: How are yöu?

It's a work colleague of Hugh's.

I think I met her at the party.

yöu know what?
I'm feeling inspired.

I'm gonna go inside and write
that letter. (CHUCKLES)

Hey.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- Do yöu wanna do something fun?
- Yeah.

(SCREAMING)

Whoo!

Yeah!

ALL: One, two, three!

(ALL CHEERING)

(JADE CHUCKLES)

We need more sparklers!

- What?
- We need more sparklers.

Okay. I'll go get some.

KEITH:
Yeah. Top shelf in the garage.

(DOOR LOCK CLICKS)

What?

- What?
- Did yöu hear something?

- JADE: David, did yöu find them?
- What?

- Uh, no, we're all out.
- We can't be.

I said we're all out, okay?

Okay. Jeez.

(EXHALES)

(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)

(DOOR OPENS)

HUGH: David, yöu're up early.

Uh...

Good morning.

Yeah. Yeah, it is, isn't it?

Listen, I was thinking about taking
the boat out for a little spin.

Ah, I'm just gonna get some coffee.

I'll make yöu one to go.

I'm gonna wait for Jade.

She's not gonna be up for hours.

Gets that from her mother.

Come on, it'll be fun.

(ENGINE REVVING)

(SIGHS)

It's beautiful, isn't it?

Yeah, we bought the place in
'96, and the kids were just...

A little poison ivy, a few too many
mosquitoes, but I just love it.

And yöu know, no matter what
was happening in our lives,

we could come out here because
nothing would seem as bad.

At least that was the idea.

There's no need for any of this.

yöu can just get to the point where
yöu ask me about last night.

Last night?

yöu and that woman yöu work with.

I don't know what
yöu think yöu saw.

I do.

I know exactly what I saw.

I'd be very careful, David.

That's a serious accusation
yöu're about to make.

If yöu think I'm gonna
tell Jade, I'm not.

If that's the reason why
yöu brought me out here.

But I'll tell yöu this.

If she found out,
it would kill her.

There's nothing to tell.

But if yöu continue down this
road, yöu will regret it.

yöu understand?

yöu've been quiet all day.

yöu okay?

Yeah. I'm all right.
I'm just tired.

Our dad's finally getting
to yöu, isn't he?

Does he compare yöu to
Chris, or is it just me?

It's all right. yöur dad's
just having a hard time.

(CHUCKLES)

No, he's been having a
hard time for a while now.

He's an asshole.
He just can't hide it anymore.

"And Chris wouldn't even
know what a frat party was!

"Communications? Isn't
that for yoga instructors?

"Arizona State?
Why not major in alcoholism?

"I mean, Jesus Christ, Keith!

"Could yöu just be better?

"Could yöu just do something?"

(CHUCKLES)

It's fine. I don't...

I don't really care.
It doesn't matter.

I'll never be anything like him.

(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

Hey. The kids went into town.
yöu up for a movie?

- I'm returning a bunch of calls.
- Okay.

This is Dr. Butterfield
for Detective Sutton.

He's a patient.

- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- (ALL SCREAMING)

Hey. What's up?

I missed all this.

(LAUGHING)

Let's be yöung and dumb,
just for tonight.

Done.

- Come on.
- Okay.

(GIRL CHEERING)

(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

Ah! Hey! What are yöu doing here?

Oh, yöu'd know if
yöu ever called me.

Listen, we all went
in on a houseboat.

We've been partying for the
last five days straight.

- I miss yöu, man.
- I miss yöu, too.

(CHUCKLES)

And what about me? Hey.

It's good to see yöu, too.

Yeah, this party's done.
We're gonna take off.

yöu two should join.

- Where to?
- We're gonna go to the zoo.

We're gonna sneak in after it closes,
we're gonna get a little high,

and then we're gonna hang out
with the wildlife. Huh? Huh?

All right, we're gonna
get a lot high.

Trust me, there's nothing like it.

I think we're just
gonna stay here, man.

No, I wanna go. Can we go?

No. We're gonna stay here.

What? Let's go. Come on.

She wants to go.

ANNE: Dear Helen,

this letter may come off
slightly unconventional,

but that seems to fit David.

It's difficult to put into words,

but his presence has affected
not only my daughter,

but our entire family.

yöu know, we don't have to do this.

I'm fine. I want to.

Charlie!

- (LAUGHS) What up?
- What up, dawg?

Hey, this is my boy, Charlie.

Turns his head every
time, all right?

Hey.

Ladies and gentlemen,
ooh, welcome to my zoo.

ANNE: He is filled with so
much light and so much love

that I can't believe this won't
translate into a very bright future.

KEITH: Fifty!

ANNE: Quite simply...

Ready or not, here I come.

ANNE: ...he's sparked
something in all of us.

A laughter in my son.

MACE: Run, run!

ANNE: An awakening in my daughter.

(CHUCKLES)

No!

(JADE CHUCKLING)

(KISSING)

(GROWLING)

Hey..ya! Okay..ya!

(ALL SCREAMING)

ANNE: A desire in me.

(SIGHS)

A desire for what?

ANNE: To be in love again.

Jade's about to leave.

We could go anywhere, start over.

I remember who yöu are.

Oh.

Who we were.

Are yöu in love with him, too?

(HUFFS)

Of course I'm not.

I love the way that he
loves our daughter.

I'm still in love with yöu.

It's a good letter.

I can mail it tomorrow
after my swim.

SABINE: Nice!

- DAVID: Let's go, come on.
- (MACE WHOOPING)

- (LAUGHING)
- DAVID: This is amazing.

- Wow.
- (TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

Wow.

SABINE: I want this one.

- MACE: This is crazy.
- KEITH: This is amazing.

- MACE: Gwen. Get over here.
- DAVID: This is awesome.

MACE: Whoo!

I'm coming to get yöu.

WOMAN OPERATOR:

Hey. Um...

I just saw some kids break
into the zoo down on Lakeview.

Mmm..hmm.

MACE: Yes!

Love is in the air, Davey.

What's that smile for?

I'm thinking of asking
Sabine to marry me.

- Wow.
- Yeah.

Does Jade know?

No one does.

I didn't even really
know until an hour ago.

Congratulations.

My dad, he'll, uh, most likely
try and talk me out of it,

and he'll probably
win, but for now...

For now, yöu're proposing.

For now, I'm proposing.
And hopefully eloping.

yöu know, man,
I'm really glad yöu came.

Thank yöu.

And I'm glad yöu're with my sister.

I haven't seen her this happy
since Chris was alive.

(CHUCKLES)

Hey, Mace! What is that?

Oh, shoot, it's the cops.
Come on, we gotta go.

(SIREN WAILING)

KEITH: Come on, go, go, go!

DAVID: We gotta get out of here.

- JADE: Hurry.
- MACE: Move, move, move!

- KEITH: Jade! Sabine, let's go.
- Mace.

- What?
- Mace, take them.

- MACE: What?
- She can't get caught. Take them!

- JADE: No!
- Jade. Jade, come on!

- Come with us, David!
- Go! Go!

Go, go, go!

MACE: Like, today! Come on!

POLICE: There he is!

Hey! Over here!

KEITH: Come on, Sabine.

yöu, stop!

Mom. Mom, wake up.

(GASPS) Jade.

- Jade. What's wrong?
- (SHUSHING)

- Shh.
- What's happened?

There was a reason I didn't
invite David on this trip.

I know, but it's because of David
that I'm not in jail, too.

No, it's because of David
that yöu've changed.

And not for the better.

Hugh, are yöu not
gonna go and get him?

I've learned a few
things about David.

It's not gonna be his
first night in jail.

We never really knew him
or what he's capable of.

yöu've been digging into his past?

Oh, rightfully so. He didn't think
to share this with yöu, did he?

I'm sure there's a perfectly
good explanation.

Well, yeah, he's a criminal.

And that's why he's
behind bars as we speak.

This could cost him his
college, his future.

He doesn't have a future, Jade.

And he's gonna make sure that
yöu don't have one either.

This is the kind of guy yöu
really want to fight for?

Yes! I don't care about his past.

There's nothing yöu can say that will
change the way I feel about him.

- Mom, please!
- Look, this is ridiculous!

I'm calling the station. Stop it.

Anne.

Please, Dad.

Get him out.

I love him.

On one condition.

Anything.

(SIREN WAILING)

As happy as I am to see yöu, I was
hoping it wasn't gonna be yöu.

Ah.

I'm sorry. Uh...

I'll pay yöu back. I promise.

I'm not concerned about the money.

Where's Jade?

She's at home.

She just knew it would make
things harder if she came.

I'm taking yöu to yöur car, David.

yöu're not coming back to
the lake house with us.

Hey, hang on. What do yöu mean?

yöur relationship with
my daughter is over.

It's time to let her go. Let her
have the success she deserves.

Is that what she wants or
is that what yöu want?

She is not here to
pick yöu up, is she?

I'll ask her myself.

She's taking the internship.

Yeah, she decided this morning.

This is just a summer fling.

It's not real love.

(SCOFFS)

yöu're in no position to lecture
me on what real love is.

yöu have no idea what
goes on in my marriage.

No.

No, I don't.

But I know yöu have
this incredible family.

I see how yöu treat them. I would
never treat Jade that way.

Oh. Oh.

Tell me, how would yöu
treat her, David?

Go ahead, tell me.

Like that kid in the police report?

I did a little research.

Is that the kind of person yöu
think I want for my daughter?

That was a long time ago.
That's not me.

I would've thought yöu would have
learned more from yöur past.

I'm sure yöur father must have.

Don't yöu talk about my dad.

No, I mean, everything I hear,
he sounds like a great guy.

Works hard, puts a roof over
yöur head, does the best he can.

It was never quite enough for
yöur mother, though, was it?

yöu have nothing.

yöu don't know what
yöu're talking about.

One day yöu get home early from
school, there's another man there.

And what do yöu do, David?

yöu beat him.

yöu beat him so badly he has to
be taken away in an ambulance.

So he goes to the hospital, yöu go
to juvie, and yöur mom takes off.

yöu know that love that yöu
talked about at dinner?

yöu're never gonna have that.
It doesn't exist.

yöur story isn't gonna end any
differently than yöur parents' did.

Jade will get bored with yöu.

Just like yöur mom got bored.

And how are yöu going
to handle yöurself when

that happens again, David? Huh?

Because it will.

It doesn't matter how hard yöu try.

yöu're not gonna be
able to hang on to her.

She is gonna get to Brown.

She is gonna meet somebody like
her, smart, with a future,

and she's gonna leave.

And she won't look back.

yöu know why?

Because yöu're not good enough.

yöu're just like yöur father.

(GROANS)

Oh.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Oh, thank yöu, David.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

yöu had my entire family fooled.

Never me.

This is the real yöu.

This is exactly who yöu are.

(DOOR SHUTS)

Oh, my God!

What happened?

What do yöu think? David lost it.

I tried to fend him off, and he...

I don't believe yöu.

Look at me.

He completely lost control.

I told him yöu were leaving...

yöu told him?
Why would yöu tell him that?

Because yöu wouldn't have.

And it's time he knows the truth.

Jade, what...

No.

He peppers him with a right,
he peppers him with a left.

He's got Hugh Butterfield
in the corner.

(CHUCKLING) What's he up to?

Damn, did yöu hit her dad?

That's messed up, even for yöu.

yöu should've never taken
us there last night.

Whoa.

It sucks that yöu got caught,
but it's not my fault.

It was stupid, Mace,
and yöu know it.

It was fun.

Until it got stupid.

But it was fun.

Come on, man, we used to do
shit like that all the time.

Yeah, but back then I didn't
have anything to lose.

So, what, yöu're going
to Brown now, too?

Oh, great. yöu invited Jenny.

How big do yöu think
our houseboat is?

(SIGHS)

She still cares about yöu,
okay? We all do.

I know yöu've been lost
in this whole Jade world.

But yöu had a whole
life before her.

yöu might want to remember that.

Hey.

Sounds like yöu had quite a night.

Yeah.

Where's Jade?

I don't want to talk about it.

What, she didn't
come to pick yöu up?

Just let it go, okay?

Hey, I'm here as a friend.
Nothing else.

Now, come on.

Move over.

David, come on, yöu had
to see this coming.

Girls like Jade Butterfield,

they just think they're
settling for guys like yöu.

(SIGHS)

But funny,

smart girls like me,

they know how lucky they are.

Jade.

(BELL DINGS)

Jade, stop.

- That didn't take long, did it?
- Listen to me.

Mace called Jenny, okay?

- Not me.
- What?

It's true. yöu hit him.

yöu don't know what he's like.

What does that mean?

That he deserved to be hit?

What did he do?

Tell me.

Wait, wait, Jade, please.

yöu have to trust me.

How? He told me what
happened with yöur mom.

Why would yöu keep that a secret?

I wouldn't have cared if
yöu had just told me.

I was ashamed, okay?

I was ashamed.

I hate what my mom did to my dad.

And I hated what I did.

If yöu thought I was such an angel,

maybe yöu should never
have bothered with me.

So that's it? yöu're
just gonna walk away?

I know I'm not good enough for yöu.

But I'm not gonna spend my
entire life proving that I am.

yöu're a coward, yöu know that?

yöu don't fight for love.

yöu're terrified of it!

(ENGINE STARTS)

(TIRES SCREECH)

Jade!

Jade!

Jade.

Jade Butterfield? Where is she?

Room 376.

KEITH: Mom.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Sweetie.

What happened?

(SNIFFLES) Honey, yöu were in a
car accident, but yöu're okay.

Where's David?

HARRY: David.

Dad.

Thanks for coming.

Any word?

No, they won't let me in.

Who's...

How is she?

Hugh Butterfield.

Harry. Harry Elliot.

yöu got a minute?

HARRY: Is she gonna be all right?

She's got a broken wrist,
among other things.

Thank God it wasn't worse.

Look. Uh...

We'd appreciate it if yöu
would show this to David.

And once we've seen
a judge on Monday,

he's a close personal
friend of family,

it will no longer be temporary.

Now, wait a minute.

I know how yöu must feel,
but they're just kids.

David, he's only 18. He's got
his whole life ahead of him.

My daughter made a
choice to move on.

He didn't respect that and
he knew the conditions.

That he couldn't get in a
fight with his girlfriend?

That he couldn't sneak into a zoo?

David's not a criminal, he's
just a kid with shit luck.

That doesn't warrant
a restraining order.

yöur son hit me in the face!

And if yöu think I'm gonna let my
daughter get anywhere near him,

yöu're out of yöur mind.

She could've died
out on that street.

He can behave like
a reckless idiot,

he can screw up his
future all he wants...

yöu say one more unkind
word about my son

and I'll make sure yöu
can't say another.


If he comes within 50 feet of
her, he's gonna be arrested,

and I'll sue yöu for everything
yöu've got. I've lost a child.

I'm not losing another.

Not for yöu

or yöur lowlife son.

yöu shouldn't be here, Jade.

I know, but I just
wanted to say goodbye

and his cell phone isn't working.

That's 'cause I took
it away from him.

Last thing I need is a
cop showing up here

'cause yöur daddy sees our
number on the phone bill.

Now, I'm sorry, honey.

I won't say anything, I promise.

That's not how it works.

I got to protect my son now

and talking to yöu ain't
gonna do him any favors.

Can yöu at least tell
him that I love him?

Don't ask that, Jade.
That's not fair.

yöu go to college,
yöu start yöur life.

That's the best thing yöu
can do for David now.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

What's up, Big D?
What's going on, man?

NESBITT: So why don't yöu
tell me why yöu're here.

I guess my dad wanted
me to talk to someone.

I've been going to yöur
dad's shop for a long time,

and he's never made
this call, so...

I guess he wants me to feel better.

To move on.

NESBITT:
And yöu don't think yöu can?

DAVID: I don't think I should.

Maybe for some people,

they find the one that they're meant
to spend the rest of their lives with.

Right when their lives
are starting out.

What if Jade's the one

and I let her go?

I would regret that for
the rest of my life.

I just... I love it here.

I'm sorry. Do yöu want
me to leave yöu alone?

No. I'm just missing home.

NESBITT: Time helps.

It's slow and it's
painful, but it works.

Talking helps.

Going out with other
people, seeing friends.

And she'll be like a
book yöu read long ago.

I always wanted a Porsche.

yöu know? It's the life...

yöu think that's possible?

If yöu trust that if it's meant
to be, then it will be again.

And if it's not, yöu
will wake up one day

and realize that yöu haven't
even thought of her once.

And then yöu'll be free.

Are yöu all right, son?

No.

What do yöu want, David?

I want her.

I don't know why yöu
don't understand that.

Yeah, maybe I just didn't wanna.

What happened with yöur
mom, that was my fault.

I worked too hard.

I didn't make her happy.

Maybe she never loved me.
I don't know.

I never fought for her.

But I saw yöu and Jade together.

She loved yöu.

She believed in yöu.

I'm not letting yöu make
the same mistake I did.

Fight for her.

He'll take the shop
and he'll sue yöu.

yöu let that asshole try.

yöu love this girl?

Yeah, I love her.

yöu really love her?

Yeah.

Then yöu fight for her and I'll
be proud of yöu if yöu do.

I always wondered who did that.

(GASPS)

(CHUCKLES)

Shameful but necessary.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Do yöu want to get a coffee?

yöu didn't know Hugh
before all this.

I haven't lost all hope.

If we can get through
losing a child,

we can get through anything.

I know what's been done, David.

Don't judge me, yöu've
never been married.

How is she?

Uh...

She has a boyfriend.

His name is Miles.

He's pre med, too.

yöu didn't want to
hear that, sorry.

It doesn't change anything.

I didn't think so.

Is she coming home for Christmas?

She is, but Hugh's never gonna
let her out of his sight.

He has his daughter back and
he's not gonna let her go now.

Just tell me where she'll be.

I'll meet her anywhere,
anywhere yöu would arrange.

I can't, David. I'm so sorry.

Anne, please.

(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA)

(SIGHS)

David didn't get into UGA.

Did yöu know that?

Uh, no, I didn't.

Although I'm not surprised.

I am.

It's why I called Helen and she
said she never got my letter.

yöu told me it went
out with the mail.

It did.

Oh, Hugh.

How could yöu have fallen this far?

yöu've ruined this kid's future.

He's barely keeping afloat.

How do yöu know how
he's keeping afloat?

Because I saw him, Hugh.

It wasn't fair of yöu.
It's not right.

yöu saw him?

Yes, I did.

And did he ask about Jade?

(CHUCKLES) Of course he did.

Did yöu tell him that
she's arriving today?

Hugh?

Hugh.

Hugh, this is it.

How yöu act right now determines
the rest of our lives.

Let this go.

Stop persecuting the poor kid
and look at who yöu've become.

No.

(WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA)

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

- Sir.
- I got to get back there.

- yöu got to get back in line.
- Listen, my daughter may be in danger.

We have a restraining order...

Do yöu have a ticket for
a departing flight?

Please slow down, sir. Walk.

- WOMAN: Oh.
- Sorry.

(GASPS)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

- No, David, I can't.
- I'm sorry.

I had to see yöu.
I know it's crazy.

yöu could be arrested, David.

- My dad's here. yöu could go to jail.
- I know.

Just hear me out, okay?

Two tickets.

We can leave tonight.
We could go anywhere.

This isn't over, Jade.

I refuse to believe it's over.

I haven't moved on.

And I don't think yöu have either.

Do yöu love this other guy?

Do yöu love him like yöu love me?

Do yöu?

(EXHALES)

Of course not.

I won't love anyone
like I love yöu.

- We're leaving tonight.
- Okay.

- Okay. We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

And we'll leave this place behind.

yöu promise?

- I promise.
- Okay.

Go.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

I got a restraining
order against a guy

who may have just gone
through security.

She's on a flight from Providence.

- She's at Gate 11 and I got to get back there.
- Dad.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Are yöu okay?
- Yeah.

- Okay.
- Is everything okay?

- Yeah, it's fine.
- Yeah.

- We're fine.
- Okay. Have a nice day.

(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO)

Were yöu driving the MG?

No, it must have been Keith.

KEITH: This is the one.

When the CD player blew, we had to
bring all the records downstairs.

- SABINE: It's awesome.
- (KEITH CHUCKLES)

What are yöu doing in here?

We were just listening.

He always had the best records.

This is not supposed to...

Oh, look at this. yöu scratched it.

yöu're supposed to put them back
in the sleeves immediately.

Dad, they're just records.

These are just things.
He'd want us to play them.

He's not here to ask, is he?

- No, I guess he's not.
- (SIGHS)

Keith.

- Where are yöu going?
- Sabine's.

Keith, what happened?

We disturbed the museum. I can't...

Every time I try to make
any kind of effort,

he just lashes out at me,
and I won't do it anymore.

I'm so sorry.

He has no respect
for Chris' things.

He knows better.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

- Where are yöu going?
- I'm going with my son.

- (CAR DOOR CLOSES)
- (ENGINE STARTS)

HUGH: I'm sorry, honey.

(SIGHS)

yöu can't make the
rules for us anymore.

- We're adults.
- Well, then act like one.

yöu have wanted me to
choose this entire time.

Well, finally, I have.

I choose to live my own life.

I choose David.

Jade. Jade.

Jade.

Jade!

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

- (CELL PHONE BEEPS)
- Hi.

(WHISPERING) I'll be right out.

DAVID: Okay.

(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

(EXHALES)

JADE: What are yöu doing?

Dad! Dad!

Dad, stop!

Whoa.

I warned yöu, David. yöu are
not taking my daughter.

- Whoa.
- JADE: Dad!

Get back in yöur car.

- Get the hell off my property.
- Dad, don't! Dad!

I told yöu to stay
away from my family!

Hey, she wants to go with me!

- Please! Dad!
- Get back in yöur fucking car!

Dad, stop! yöu're gonna kill him!

She wants to be with me.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Let's go. Come on.

(SIGHING DEEPLY)

Oh, no, no.

Oh.

Hugh?

DAVID: Hugh? Keith?

(COUGHING)

Hugh?

Hugh, come on. We got to go.

Help me get his things!

There's too much smoke. Come on.

Don't open the window!

(GROANS)

(HORN BLARING)

My dad and my boyfriend are inside!

- Inside? Upstairs? Downstairs?
- I don't know!

David!

We gotta go!

We gotta go!

David!

(GRUNTING)

Here. (GRUNTS)

yöu all right?

Yeah, I'm okay.

I'm okay.

Wait! Wait, where's Anne? Keith!

Anne's on her way.

(SIGHS)

I couldn't save him.

I tried.

I just...

I just couldn't.

And what I've done...

The people I've hurt.

I'm sorry.

I don't know how this happened.

(EXHALES)

It's okay.

It's not too late.

I think he's been punished enough.

Let him take yöu to the airport.

He wants to. He told me so.

Hmm?

Yeah?

- Okay.
- Good.

Let's go.

JADE:
How are yöu, Mom? Will yöu be okay?

ANNE: I don't know. (CHUCKLES)

This is something that yöur
father and I need to do.

It doesn't mean that a part
of me won't always love him,

and maybe we'll find our way
back to each other, one day.

I don't want to leave
yöu like this.

I need yöu to.

It's yöur love that inspires me, Jade.
(CHUCKLES)

Inspire me every day.

- Yeah?
- Okay.

(ENGINE TURNS OFF)

(SEATBELT CLICKS)

I'm here if yöu need me.

And even if yöu don't,
that's okay, too.

(SQUEALS)

California? That's a
long way back to Brown.

- Mmm..hmm.
- What exactly do yöu have planned?

I'm sworn to secrecy, sorry.

But we've got two days before
we go back to Rhode Island,

so I thought I'd make
them the best two days.

- Tell me.
- I can't.

Surprise!

- What?
- KEITH: Yeah.

My God.

- (CHUCKLING) Hey.
- Hi.

Oh, my God.

- Hey.
- Hey.

Mom's gonna kill yöu,
yöu know that, right?

Then we'll just have
to do it twice, then.

I, Keith, take yöu,
Sabine, to be my wife.

JADE: My first love was
everything all at once.

The kind yöu never fall back from.

Never try to.

Never want to.

A love so big, so strong,

it never dies, never fades,

never loses its electricity.

The kind of love yöu fight for.
