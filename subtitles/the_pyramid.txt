Are you getting this?

What's he doing?


they'll let us pass?

look like it.





Are you good to go?

Yeah, rolling.

Hidden within this
sprawling desert,


the public will
soon lay their eyes

on the Holdens'
groundbreaking research...

and the father-daughter team

could rewrite history
as we know it.

As you can see,
the pyramid behind me has only three sides...

not four like the Giza Pyramids.

This architectural feat
singles it out

as an exception
in this region.

have to start over.

The barking is covering
everything you're saying.

Oh, damn it.
What's wrong with those dogs?

anyway?

They're just feral dogs
running around.

Can someone get
a shotgun or something

and get rid of
these dogs, please?

Driving me crazy.

All right, let's go again.

Okay, Sunni.
Whenever you're ready,
we're good to go.

I'll ask you a question...

you try to incorporate the
question into your response.

Like if I ask you
your name, you would say...

Dr. Miles Holden.
Wrong.

Oh. Oh, right. Uh, my name is
Dr. Miles Holden.

That's what
I'm talking about.

Could you tell us what
exactly you're looking for?

Yeah. Uh, there are
certain ancient texts

which refer to this
geographic area...

<i>as</i> the possible site of the
lost pyramid of Akhenaten...

which may be related...

to the particular
and unusual

three-sided architecture
of our pyramid.

I just need to quickly
check your mic.

Yeah. It's a little
windy out here.

It's a great shot.
Just don't step backwards.

Uh...

Pyramids. Hit me with it.

Action.

Whatever we're looking at,

this is not the pyramid
of King Akhenaten.

The structure that we're dealing
with is buried below the surface.

It takes millennia for sand
to build up that high.

Which means that
this structure predates

the reign of Akhenaten
by generations.

Why are so many people
against the satellites?

Most archaeologists
are trapped in time

when it comes to
reworking methodologies...

and assimilating
new evidence

into existing historical
frameworks. Mmm.

Proving an
older genealogy

for Egyptian history
basically means...

throwing everything
they have been

working on their
entire lives into question.

Isn't that what
you're trying to do?

No, not exactly.

I respect the work
that they have done...

but we just need to know
when it's time to innovate.


buried deep beneath the desert.

Here is a scan.

Look at the size
of that thing!

That's got to be

See this tunnel here?
This is our way in.

It leads directly
to the apex of the pyramid.


It's the tip
of the pyramid.

Mmm. Pyramids don't normally
have apexes at the entrance.

But this one does.
Who dug the tunnel?

We don't know yet.
That's also part of our discovery.

Nora, tell me
about the satellites.

I'm not the first
archaeologist

to break ground using
satellite technology.

But I was inspired
to apply it...

after an article that I read
about SETI out of New Mexico.

SETI?

"Search for Extraterrestrial
intelligence."

They were using
the satellites...

to search for traces of water
underneath the surface of Mars.

I thought we were here to
talk about Egypt, not aliens.

about all those theories?

About aliens
coming to Earth?

And that the pyramids
are just giant transmitters?

Even I have my limits.

Do you see, uh,
how these ridges

form a barrier
around the pyramid?

Dad.Dad.

Could you please stop touching
buttons that you don't understand?


Where was that taken?

It doesn't matter
when it was taken.

I said where.

the satellite stuff...

is such a small part
of what we're doing.

We should be talking
about archaeology,

about the pyramid,
about Akhenaten, and...

the whole satellite angle...

is what interested the
network in the first place.

It's the dawn of a new age
in archaeology.

Using the future
to understand the past.

Anything else I'm not
supposed to see?

Would you just mind your own business?
Thank you very much.

I'm sorry.
You are my business, all right?

Archaeology used to be
about digs and dirt.

But we've lost
the raw sensation

with all this
technological mediation.

Great.

Uh, how was that, Fitz?

award-winning.

Okay. Let's wrap up.
We're done for the day.

Sorry.






Hey.

No, I'm fine, Mom.

I'm fine. Don't worry.

Cairo is far, far away.

And we're supposed
to break through tomorrow.

So if we get far enough,
we'll be safer underground...

than we will be
in a war bunker.

No, I'm not
taking it lightly.

I'm just trying
to focus on my work.

Could you please not worry?

You know Dad is enough
to handle as it is.

Okay. I love you, too. I do.



Uh, Mom, I have to go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

I love you. Bye.

Zahir, get your
metallic junk out of here.


Jesus!

What the hell is that?

Whoa.

introduce you to Shorty.

He's gonna be our first set
of eyes and ears inside...

after we make
initial breakthrough.

He stands just over
one foot tall...

with six wheels on a Rocker-Bogie
suspension system...

which was originally
designed

by NASA for their
Mars rovers...

to allow them to travel over
the rough Martian terrain.

I bet this thing
is a real babe magnet, eh?

Uh, some of the missions
Shorty has been on are...

Michael Zahir,
our robotics engineer.

But it seems
he wasn't briefed...

on which
million-dollar territories

he would be exploring.

Oh, don't you worry,
Nora.

I've got two
primary camera feeds...

sending back real-time footage
to our command center.

So everything Shorty sees
is permanently recorded.

Right, partner?

Look out.



We're not shooting
<i>Days Of Our Lives.</i>

Stop wasting
your memory space.


People would love to see
these two nerds get freaky.

Dr. Holden!
Dr. Holden!

what's he saying?


What? Come on!
Come on!

Are you all right?
Give me your hand.

You got it?

slow down.

You coming?

Tell them not to open it up yet.
Tell them to hold off.


I need you to translate.



Here it comes.



Get him out of here!


to medical!

Oh, my God.
We have to do something!

Aspergillus.

What's aspergillus?

Inhalation
of toxic air.

It's actually not as
uncommon as it sounds.

What causes it?

A fungi usually found
in caves and tombs...

structures that
have been sealed off.

This pyramid
could be way older

than even I had
originally thought.

Nora, please. Stop spinning out
your wild theories.

I am trying to
reassure the university...

that we're going to be
doing things on schedule.

has to be turned off.

Nobody goes
near that pyramid

without my permission,
all right?

And nobody mentions the
word "curse." Understood?

I don't want any of that
crazy nonsense on my site.

Our site.


What?

What?

What's wrong?

What's wrong?

You can't shut us down.

We're about to
launch Shorty.

it's the government.</i>

<i>The Ministry of Antiquities</i>

<i>is ordering all
research teams in the area...</i>

<i>to pull out immediately.</i>

<i>They want you
cleared out in 24 hours.</i>

When will we be able
to resume the excavation?

<i>We don't know yet.</i>

I don't understand.

<i>You've been in
the desert too long.</i>

<i>You should see what's happening
in the streets of Cairo.</i>

<i>It's mayhem.</i>

<i>Wide-scale violence between the
military and the protesters.</i>

<i>They're fearing a civil war.</i>

But this isn't Cairo.

Yeah, we are in the
middle of the desert.

<i>You don't get it.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Miles,</i>

<i>but you have to be out
by tomorrow morning.</i>

We are so close!


There goes my Emmy.

Nora, this is not
a discussion.

The final answer is no.
Thank you.


Would you please hand these out
to everybody you see around here?

This place needs to

look like we were
never here by morning.

What is going on?

It's all written down there.
This is not a conference.

Now just go, please.

So, that's it?

Oh, what would you
like me to do?

How about anything?

You barely
put up a fight.

I don't fight battles
I can't win.

I have got a career
to think of,
and so do you.

Don't forget that!
Okay.

But we can't walk away from
here with nothing to show.

I am not...

Dad, please!
This is the find of the century.

And you're going to give
up when we are this close.

We owe this to our name.

What's the harm?

Besides toxic air poisoning?

We won't go in ourselves.

We'll just send in Shorty.

He can take some readings
and some pictures.

A couple of hours.

Nobody will even know
that we were gone.

Dad, I know
what you're thinking.

Look me in the eye
and tell me...

that you don't wanna see what's
going on in that pyramid.

Trust me.


Yes!

Egypt is following you,

and he doesn't look happy.

Hold on.

Let me talk to him
real quick.


Zahir,
what is he saying?

He's wondering why we still
have our stuff here.

He's here to supervise us,

make sure we get on
the plane tomorrow.

Tell him not to worry,
that we are
wrapping things up...

that everything is on schedule.

Dad, what the hell?


Fine, fine.


the air check out?

No. Don't even
think about it, Nora.

There's no way
you're going in there.

Actually,
according to the meters,

it's showing minimal traces
of toxic fumes...

but definitely
below dangerous levels.

But I'm assuming

it's because we're
still close to the entrance.


of my workspace, please?

It's a $3 million rover.
Yeah, I can enhance it.

Okay, zoom in. Zoom in right there.
Make that larger. Zoom in.

What?

This says "slaughter."

This says "God."

says "underworld."


Relax, Fitzie,
these are just symbols

to scare away
grave robbers.



That, my dear,
is the symbol of Osiris.

Osiris?
He's the god of the afterlife.

He's also considered by the
Egyptians <i>as</i> the first pharaoh.


Okay, what was that?

It must've been a dog.

Got in somehow.

They left the opening
unguarded.

Let's just keep our
wits sharp, all right?


Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

What?


You guys hear that?

I've lost
all external control.

Both the camera feeds.

Hold on, hold on. Damn dogs.
You mean...

Hold on.

Shorty's offline.

I got to go get him.

You are not going in there.
We have no idea what's in there.

Could be fumes still.

No. Be realistic, Zahir.

Be realistic?

I just told you how much
that rover costs, okay?

It's on loan.
Does he not know
how this works?

We have to be on a plane.

And you don't think
NASA's gonna be pissed

to find out
we lost their rover?

Okay, okay.
But just the two of us.

That is not happening.

Okay, we have no idea if we're
gonna be able to come back here.

You're crazy if you think I'm
not going in there with you.

The camera goes
everywhere you do.

You agreed to that
back in the U.S.

right to just hang back here.

You guys can go on...
Get your ass in there.

Okay.

Hope you brought
those extra batteries.

We're gonna need them.

Oh, I thought we were
the only ones filming.

of a notebook.

I don't want
to miss anything.

Uh...

Yeah, we're coming.
Let's go.


to get Shorty out,
if it doesn't work?


he doesn't know either.

So, I think these
flares might help us

take care of our
stray dog problem.


He's saying
we can't go in there.

Keep rolling!

to calm down!

I'm trying.


Let me try
to talk to him.



I can't get it,
they're going too fast.

He's making a plea
of some kind.

Uh, from one Egyptian
to another.

I think it's working.

All right, guys,
we've got two hours
to get Shorty.



It's just something
to help us find our way back.

You know, in case we decide
to go in a little further.

Further?

Great.

They don't seriously expect
us to wear these, do they?


let's go.


The structure could
collapse at any moment.

And don't touch anything.

Stay close.

Imagine, the last people
who walked these tunnels...

died thousands of years ago.


the ancient Egyptians

only stood about
five feet tall...

so watch your heads.

taller in here.


have dragged him too far.


There's no tracks.
He couldn't have just disappeared.

Guys...

which way do we go now?

No, no!



I'm dead. I'm dead.


NASA's gonna be pissed.


I'm dead.

I'm freaking dead!



I'm sure we can find
the rest of him.



Is this the apex thing
you were talking about?

There's something
in the wall.

What's up there?

one way to find out.

Please don't fall. Be careful.

your hand. Come on.

Okay, ready?



I almost have the ledge.

Yeah. I got it. Okay.




come check this out.




anything like this before.

was supposed to be a tomb.




The ancient Egyptians
buried their pharaohs...

with an armory of spears,
for use in the afterlife.

Usually, they're placed

next to the sarcophagus,
never separately.

Huh?


Mended at the shaft.
It's broken.

And I wonder...
Yeah, look at this.

There's a chip in this blade.

So these...
These were not just ceremonial.

These saw battle.







I'll have to take it back

and analyze it
and date it.

We won't know until then,

so go ahead and take that
as a sample.





Oh.

It must have snapped.

wire, Doctor,

it doesn't just snap.



You probably
didn't realize

but you must've done it
as you were filming.

You probably stepped on it!

It's all right.

with his stupid robot.

just calm down.

We're not that far
from the entrance.

We'll set up
another wire.

All right.


Okay?

Wait, wait, wait.

It's not this way,
it's that way.

Look, I copied down
the hieroglyphs

in my notebook
before we set off...

as we entered.

from this direction over here.

look the same.

miny, moe.

That's enough, Fitzie.

Look, guys. It's this way.
It's this way.

we attach a wire.

That's strange.

These hieroglyphs
are all the same.

for a few minutes.

or is it becoming really,

really hard to breathe
in these masks?

are incredibly airtight.

Explains how
mummies can remain

so perfectly preserved
after all these years.

I'm not talking about

some pyramid
mumbo-jumbo here.

I'm being serious.
Something's off.


I don't want to
lose anybody. Okay?

back to where we were?

I think it was back...


I was positive.

I'm sorry, honey.

We have to go back
in the other direction.

This looks...

came the wrong way.

chamber be?




Oh, come on!

We should not be here.
Let's get out.



Nobody move.

All right.

All right.

Oh, my God.

What's happening?

is about to collapse.


out of here one at a time.

Fitzie? Come on.
You first.


not to step on the cracks.


That's good.

Come on.
That's good, Fitzie.

Don't jump! Just...

Okay, Okay-

Just come on,
come on, come on.

Good, good, good.

that's good, that's good.

That's right.


That's good.
That's good.

Come on.
That's good, Fitzie.

Okay, now, Zahir.
Come on. Come on.

Come!


Oh, my God.

it's all right.

Michael, faster!


Whoa!



(ALL GROANING)</font>







I can't breathe

with this stupid mask.

Oh! 

What is that smell?



I'm guessing
where the animal

who destroyed Shorty decided
to relieve itself. 

for just one dog

who got trapped.

Not only that,
where did it go?

How'd it get out?

The only way out is up.

to get out of here soon.

I haven't smelt anything this
bad since Zahir's tent...

when he had the beans
the other day. 

What the hell
is wrong with you, man?



Michael, Michael!





We're gonna get you out of here.

Okay, come on, guys!
Help me, please!




We need to push,
all right?

All right.
All right, push!

One, two, three.


Push, push, push!


Okay.

doing with the phone?

You're not gonna get
reception down here.

We're 90 feet below ground.

The walls are six feet thick.

Jesus, use your head.

gonna be able to get

this rock off of him by ourselves.

And even if we do...

in there, get it out.

Hey, hey.
Listen to me.

Look at me. Look at me.

Look at me. Take these.

I want you to swallow these, okay?
I want you to swallow.

Here you go.

okay, Doctor?

He's not gonna die, is he?


Just shut up, please!

You're not helping
right now, okay?

Michael, Michael. Breathe.

Look at me. Michael.

You are going to
get out of here, okay?

Just breathe, that's right.

Breathe.

something could still fall.


looking at?

This shaft should take us
back to where we came from.

You know, I think
I can get up there.

that's not a good idea.

I've been rock climbing
my entire life.

If you give me a boost,
I can brace myself in there and shimmy up.


Can you tell her
she's crazy?

I can do it.



Here, take this.

That way we can
watch on the monitor.


How's that? You're picking
that up? Yeah?

All right.

Okay. All right.

be careful.






just take your time, okay?


don't take too long.

Just let us know
if you see anything.



You okay? Go slow, okay?




trying to break
my concentration!

Are you okay?

hear that?





Let us know as soon <i>as</i> you
see anything, okay, Sunni?

is up here.

There's some kind of low
tunnel perpendicular to us.


(SCREAMING)</font>


Oh, my God!
Sunni, are you okay?

Oh, God.


Okay.

I think I've got shit in my ear.

Here, use this.

What happened up there?

I saw something.

I was almost there
and it popped out at me.

This is gonna
sting, okay?


a good look.

But when I saw it,
I lost my...

I have another bag.

I saw its eyes.

What was it?


It was the same thing we saw

before we lost
contact with Shorty.

Sorry, sorry.

You know,
maybe it's the soldier.

He knows we're down here.
He's probably gonna be looking for us.

A soldier popped out of a hidden
tunnel and scratched my face.

Maybe there's a way
out over there.

Michael.

These carvings
tell a story.

You see these figures
holding the spears.

These are the same ones
we saw in the apex.

This is a warning.

A warning?

A warning for what?

I don't know.

I think we should
just stay here.

That soldier will come
looking for us eventually.

No, Michael might not
have that long.

We have to look
for another way out.

All right, then, fine.

What is your
plan now, Nora?

a gate here...

then behind those stones
there is a passage...

and maybe another way out.

And if the gate has been standing
here for thousands of years...

maybe it's standing here
for a reason.

Who are we to destroy it?


Stop being an archaeologist
for a minute here...

and start being
a human being!

Look, she's right,
okay?

We have to look
for help!

Maybe we can try the shaft.
Nora!

Look at her face!

We don't know
what's up there!

just sit around here.

Okay, we've got
things up there

scratching people's faces.

It stinks in here!

So put your mask
back on.

No, I'm serious, man.
Listen...

if we can survive this drop
then so can it.

Whatever it is.

And while we're
trapped in here

we're like food
in a bowl right now.

All right, fine.

I got it. Let's go over here.

Yeah, we're fine.


Ready? One, two...

(ALL EXCLAIM)</font>


if it's safe in there.

For all we know
that air could be...

our chances.

not gonna be any worse...

than the air
we're breathing in here.

Yeah.


You take it.
No. Mmm-mmm.

No. What, you want
to sit here in the dark?

No.

And besides,
if we get lost

then maybe we can
follow the light back.

Okay?

You're not gonna need the hatchet,
but it's just in case.

I'm gonna go get
you help, okay?

I'm gonna
come back for you.





It's that soldier! What's his name?
Shadid!

Shadid!




Uh, can't tell.



Did you guys
hear that?


What's happening to him?

You guys, that's not Shadid.
That's Michael.

Michael!

Find Shadid!
Nora, wait!


just go with them?

How are we supposed
to find Shadid?

Hello?

Shadid!

Are you still there?


Michael.

Oh, my God.


Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

No, no, no-

No, this isn't happening.



not possible.

I think we have to get out of here.


No, no...

No, it's not happening. No.

Nora.
I don't believe it.

Nora, Nora.
No, I...

Honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

I know you cared for him,
but we have to go.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Honey, we have to go.
Michael!

We have to join the others, okay?
I can't...

Okay, honey, you've got
to focus now.

We got to get out
of this pyramid.

It's not safe for us.
Come on.

Where did he go?

Come on.
Okay, come on.

Come on.
I can't.

Come on.

We should never
have followed them.

so long?

Should we go back there?

Shadid!

Shadid, can you hear us?

All right.

to Zahir?


shift the boulder.

It rolled over
and crushed him.

We couldn't shift

that thing
between the four of us!

I think he was

chipping away at it
with the hatchet.

a load of bull.

We heard the screams.

If there's anything
we've learned today

it's that you're talking
out of your ass.

she's right, yeah.

You're lying to us.

What about the eyes I saw
at the top of the tunnel?

Whatever took a chunk
out of my face killed Zahir!

don't tell me to calm down!


but robot guy
has just been devoured...

by a creature we cannot
identify, for Christ's sake!

"Calm down."

Who the hell
do you think...

Nobody made you come!

My job is to follow
you guys with the camera.

What, are you just
following orders now?

Step up and take
responsibility

for your own actions!

Hey! Back off!

Keep her away from me!
Back off!

Jesus, Sunni, relax.

Don't tell me to relax!

This asshole has led us
into a death trap!

I don't need
this right now.

all right?

You're panicking
and you're freaking out!

You're just looking for
someone to blame right now.

Oh, I found him.


is not going to help us out
right now, is it?

All right, just relax.

Come on,
just breathe.

I'm sure we can find
a way out of here.

What we need to do
is to find Shadid.

He got in here,
we can get out.

Yeah.
How's that?



What's up?

No, it was nothing.

Come on, Fitzie,
you go first.


Me?
Yes.

a bloody guinea pig?

Oh, for God's sake.

Are you seeing
how tight this is?


Bloody hell.

this is the way?

of anything in this place.


remind me again, guys,

what do I do if this
thing jumps out at me...

and scratches my face off?

You try to put as much distance
<i>as</i> you can between you and it.

<i>as</i> fast <i>as</i> I can move right now.

Just move faster, Fitzie!

I don't want to be here
long enough to find out!

Guys.



Something's behind us!

What do we do? What do we do?


Just move, Fitzie! Move!

Go! Go! Go!
Go <i>as</i> fast <i>as</i> you can, Fitzie!


Shit.



There's something here.

Shit!

Keep going.

It's coming faster!



Where the hell
did he come from?

Hurry up, Fitzie!

Keep moving. Keep moving.

(NORA YELLING)</font>


Get back.

Everybody, get back!
Get back!



(EXCLAIMS)</font>


What the hell was that?





Come on.

Turn it off.
Kill the light!



Just don't move a muscle.



We should be very quiet.




was that?


the claws on that thing?

What the hell
is going on down here?




Whoa, Sunni, that scratch
is becoming really infected.

Your eye is not looking
too good, either.

We need to find
an exit right now.


Please tell me there is
something on this wall...

that explains how
to get out of here...

or at least what the
bloody hell is after us.

This panel depicts the final judgment,
the weighing of souls.


Egyptian Book of the Dead.

When a person died,
they passed into a room.

They were brought before
Osiris and a panel of judges.

And next to them
was a massive scale.

Then the god Anubis
weighed their heart

against Maat,
the goddess of truth.

And if it balanced
perfectly,

they passed
into the afterlife.

they were sent to the sky

to dwell among the stars.

I thought
the Book of the Dead

was just full of spells
and incantations.

it's more than that.

It's a guide
to immortality.

This was central
to Egyptian philosophy.

This is the final milestone.

in this rubbish, do you?

They believed it.

I think the priests
acted out this ritual.

None of this matters
unless we get out of here.

We've got to go.
Let's go! Let's go.

What do you see?

It's a dead end.

(GRUNTS)</font>

Fuck!



don't touch anything.





What...

(SAND POURING)</font>

if we don't go!

Come on!



Come on!

Nora!


Nora, come on!

Come on!

I'm stuck!

Guys!

Dad!

Dad!

Help!




Guys, I'm stuck! Help!

All right. Give us...


Oh, God!

Oh, my God! Sunni!

Give me your hand.

Give me your hand. Come on!
Just pull! Wiggle your legs!

I'm gonna help you!

I'm gonna get you!

Guys!



No!

No, no, no, no! Don't!

Sunni!

Guys!

Help! We need your help!

Oh, God.


Please... Sunni...

Get away!

Help!

Give me your hand!

Help me.
Just don't...

Keep at it!
Dad!

You're doing great. Come on. Give me...
Dad!

Wiggle your legs!

Come on, honey!
You have to keep squirming!

Nora!


I'm gonna get you! Guys!

Right there.

Come on. Come on.

Come on,
and give me your hand!

Come on! Come on, Nora!

Hold on! Nora!

Got it! God...

Come on. I got your hand.

I got you, I got you.


Pull!
I am... 


Nora...

Thank God. Thank God.


Doctor!




Okay!

Come here, guys.
Fitzie, get on the corner.

Take the rope.
I'm gonna throw it to you. All right?

Get the end. You got it?

Sunni, just hold on,

we're coming
right down, all right?

Watch out!

Wait.



That's right.
You're doing great.


Here, here.


Okay-


Lift up...

Right there, okay.
Is that better?

Is that better? Okay.

Just try not to
breathe so hard, all right?

Long breaths, yeah.

Ow!

Nora. Come on,
change places with me.

Cradle her head.

Okay. Okay.
Just take her head.



We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

Right, guys?

All right,
we're gonna get you off, Sunni.

Okay, you got her legs?
Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Pull straight up,
all right?

On the count of three.
One...

two...

three.


Come on!





It's not working.

she's gonna bleed out.



Okay, let's try again.

No! She can't take it.

Just give her a second,
all right.


Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Hold her. Hold her, hold her.
Oh, my God!

Sunni! I'm trying!
Hold her! Hold her!

I'm trying!
Hold her! Hold her still!

I can't, I can't!
She can't twist!

Hold her!
I can't!

She's gone into...

Okay.


Sunni?


Oh, my God.


I think I can
get her leg off.

I think if I just
get her leg off,

then we can get her
out of here.

Oh, my God.


We need to get her off.



can come back at any minute.

We have to go now.

Dad?

Your neck.

Oh, shit, is that...

Probably.

Just...

appeared now?

stopped the onset.

For some reason,
the progress has been slowed.

say anything?

What difference
does it make?

If I'm infected, we all will be.
It doesn't...


out of here right now.

Well, that's
our only choice.



Yeah.
All right.

Those things...
I think they're Sphynx cats.


The ancient Egyptians believed that cats,
like Bastet...

were the guardians
of the underworld.

They could have
been placed here

to protect whomever
was buried in here.


survived all this time

without any food or water?

they ate each other.

Each generation
feeding the next.

Like, uh, rats.

so to survive down here,

you have to resort
to cannibalism.

That would explain
the air toxicity.

an opening overhead.

Fitzie, bring your camera here,
I need the light.

possibly be back here?

It's a labyrinth.

Wait, wait, wait.
Let's just think this through logically.

All right, we can't go that way,
that's a sand trap.

And we know that
that's a dead end.

But Corporal Shadid
got in here somehow,

so there has to be
a way out.

How can we...

Look.


Shorty.

You know, this antenna
might still be

broadcasting a signal
to the outside.

Well, what are you thinking?



(GASPS)</font>

I can rewire
my camera to it

and we can record
a message...

and send it to one of
the outside monitors.

Well, will that work?

I mean...

I can't guarantee
anyone's gonna see it,

but, it'd improve our odds.


Ah.

Look. Ah.

Okay, so, uh,
be quick, Doctor.

I'm not sure how long this
aerial battery's gonna last

And also, you know,
the cat creatures.

will bother to play back

these tapes
when they find our gear.

If they find it.


My name is Dr. Miles Holden.

And I was a professor
at Princeton University.

I am trapped in the excavation
site with my daughter...

Dr. Nora Holden, and cameraman
Terry Fitzsimmons.

And we need help.

Two of our team members,
engineer Michael Zahir...

and documentary filmmaker
Sunni Marshe, are dead.

This pyramid, unlike any other
structure I've ever encountered...

seems to have been built
with the express purpose...

of keeping whatever
is inside from escaping.

If you come down here,
bring guns.

Is that good?

Yeah, it was good.
It was really good.

Did you feel that?

Yeah.



pulling the air out.

What is it?

I think something's
back there.

I think it's a way out.




Careful, Doc.

Remember the last time
you started touching things.




How did you
find that?

I didn't spend my entire life
behind a desk, you know.


Shadid came this way?

I do.

look like the Egypt stuff

you find at the British Museum,
eh, guys?

could be a link

to an older civilization.



how are you feeling, Doc?

get out of here.




I mean, do you feel
any sicker or...

You know what?
I really haven't

had that much time
to think about it.


Oh, man.



So...



to the kitty tomb...

that, you know,
also smells like shit.

You think this was built

to be some sort of prison,
then, Doc?

Oh, well, many temples
in the ancient world...

were thought to be the earthly
dwelling places of the gods.

Some were benign
and giving.

Others, like the gods
the Aztecs worshipped,

were violent.

They were imprisoned...

and then they were
fed a steady diet

of human sacrifice
to appease them.

Thousands were sacrificed.

As their hearts
were cut out...

their bodies were kicked down
the pyramid steps.

So, what's your point?

Whatever
we're dealing with,

it's not benign
and giving.

into this hellhole.

Make it completely impossible for
them to discover our bodies.



the bottom of the pyramid.


Well...

have to find...

the right escape shaft.


Dad?

Dad?
What?


Well, well, well, well.

We were not
the first ones here.

to him?

Shit, look at that.

What?


That's a Freemason symbol.

They must've built the offshoot
tunnel that we entered.

Yeah, it makes sense.

yeah, this is all very interesting...

but our main priority should
be getting out of here.

aren't important.

excellent tomb robbers.

If they couldn't
find a way out...

Shit.


I can't read this.
What is that?

Here, give it to me.

Guys, can we drop the history
crap for five minutes, please...

and get out of here?


It's a journal.

Fitzie, I need your light.

"May 21st, 1897.

"The path we took
upon our entry

"into the pyramid
has been blocked.

"We may have located

"a means of escape
in the burial chamber."

That's the last entry.


And this looks like
the burial chamber to me.

All right. Well, then...

there might be
a means of escape!


We have to keep going.
We don't want to end up...



Dad! Dad!

(GROWLING)</font>



No! I have to go
back for him!

No, we can't!
I have to go back!

I'm sorry,
we've got to go!

Keep going!


What? No!

No! No!

Oh, my God.




I can't...


He's gone.

He's gone.

There must be
some sort of latch...

or mechanism
that your dad found.

I don't know.

I don't...

You know what?

Screw it.

I'd rather face him
once and for all

than spend the rest
of my life running.

Are you out of your mind?

Nora, come on.

Look at all this shit
we've been through!

Someone will find
our tapes.

The least I can do
is let people know

who killed me.

What is wrong with you?

My dad just died and all you
care about is getting your shot.

It's not about
the shot, Nora.

I just don't know
what else to do.

Fitzie,
please don't leave me.

Fitzie, please...

Fitzie...






(HOLDEN GROANING)</font>

Oh, God.






Help... Help, help...

No...

















It's me.



No, this can't be happening.

It's impossible.

It's Anubis,
or the Devourer.

He took my father's heart
to weigh his soul.


What are you
talking about?

Anubis, half man,
half jackal.

He ate the hearts of those
he found to be impure.

In the Book of the Dead...

the Last Judgment
is the final gate

before resurrection
or damnation.

If there's a way out,
it's inside that room.

We don't have a choice.

We can either stay here
and die, or we...

Or we can die trying.

it's the soldier.

Come on, Nora.

I'm so sorry, Dad.


Grab his flare.

Wait.


it tells the story of Osiris.

Osiris. No, no, no.

You said Anubis.

Osiris was his father...

or his creator.

It's the same symbol
for both words.

Egyptians believe Osiris
came from the heavens...

and brought agriculture
and tool-making...

I get that you find
this stuff fascinating, okay?

But right now
what we should be

working on is
how to get out of here.

That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

Osiris knew that his time
had come on Earth...

so he had
this pyramid built

for his journey
into the afterlife.

Nora, I promise you,
look...

I've got it all
down on tape. All right?

You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

Anubis turned his wrath
on the people.

He had hundreds
of them sacrificed...

so he could join his father
in the afterlife.

Since his soul
was corrupted,

he was looking
for a pure one...

a pure heart, if you will.

The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

My father was right.

This pyramid
became a prison.

Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own god.

Nora, does this thing
give us any clues

on how to get out of here?

It says something
about a star map.

Then you got
to find it, okay?

Because your friend Anubis is
gonna be back any minute now!

The exit shaft
points to where the dead

was supposed to be
resurrected.


There must be at least
six shafts in this room.

How do we know
which is the right one?

The stars...

Look at the ceiling.

Fitzie,
turn off your light.

Look at the ceiling.

In between the hieroglyphs,
all those dots.

That's the star map!

So what exactly
are we looking for?

The tetrahedron.

The three-sided
pyramid is also

the hieroglyphic symbol
for the Sirius star.

Look! There it is.

The brightest one.

It's right above
this shaft.

It's got to be our way out!

Okay. Well, let's go
check it out.


It's got to be the one.

Look! The rope.

That's got to be
how the soldier entered.

Captain Egypt.

You think that thing
will hold us both?

I guess we have to see.

Okay-

All right, you go first.

Here, take this.

Just in case.

I'll be right behind you.

Okay, hold that.


Okay-


Yeah, I'm good.

your leg up on that ledge.




Can't be much further now.


Shit! He's back!

Go, Nora! Go!

Don't look back!
Fitzie, keep going! Don't look down!


Go, Nora! Go! Go! Go!

Come on, Fitzie, move!

I'm coming!
Move! Move!

Go on!

Come on, Fitzie!

You can keep going!
Come on! Don't look down!


Climb!
