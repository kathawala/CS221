STEPHEN: Well, come on!

(LAUGHING) Oh!
Come on, old man!

Coming into Trinity Lane.

Oh!
(BELL DINGS)

STEPHEN:
Eyes on the road, Brian!

Whoa!

(LAUGHS)

BRIAN: Brian spies
an opening!

A-ha!

(CHUCKLES)

Eyes on the staff!

Hawking's lost it!

Whoa!

No!

You lose, Brian.

Too slow, old man.
Too slow.

Oh, my goodness. Right.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

BRIAN: Time for a drink.

STEPHEN: Hello.

(MUSIC PLAYING)
Oo-pah!

(CHUCKLES)

What if the secret
of the universe had something
to do with sex, huh?

Maybe do your
doctorate on that.

The physics of love.

STEPHEN: I think that's
more your field, Brian.

BRIAN: Oh, not lately.

They will boot you out,
you know,
if you don't decide.

I know everyone here who's...

Brilliant. Oh, dear.

Scientists.

MAN 1:Ah, yes.
MAN 2: Ah, you made it.

Don't worry, we don't
have to stay for long.

Looks mortifyingly dull.

(SIGHS) Bores.
(STAMMERING) Who's that?

Who's who?

Oh, him? Oh...

He's strange. Clever.

I'll be back in a minute.
I'll be back in a second.

Hello.
Hello.

Science.
Arts.

English? (CHUCKLES)
French and Spanish.

What about you?
What are you...

Oh, cosmologist,
I'm a cosmologist.

What's that?

It's a kind of religion
for intelligent atheists.

Intelligent atheists?
Mmm-hmm.

You're not religious,
are you?

C of E.

Church of England?
England, yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

(EXHALES)

I suppose someone has to be.

What do cosmologists
worship, then?

What do we worship?
Mmm.

One single
unifying equation

that explains everything
in the universe.

Really?
Yes.

What's the equation?

That is the question.

And a very good question.
(CHUCKLES)

I'm not quite sure yet.

But I intend to find out.

JANE: Then why didn't you
stay at Oxford?

Because my finals exams
were such a shambles,

that the examiners,
they summoned me
in for a viva,

and they told me that
if I got a second...

What's a viva?

Oh, it's a sort of mildly
terrifying face-to-face thingy.

Like an interview?
An interrogation.

And I told them that if they
gave me a second-class degree,

then I would stay with them
and do my research at Oxford.

But if they gave me
the first that I needed
to get into Cambridge,

then they would never
have to see me again.

They gave you the first.

They gave me a first.
Of course.

(CHUCKLES) This party
is officially deceased.

Come on,
I fixed up a ride home.

Come on, Jane.

(SIGHS) Jane.

Well, it was lovely
to talk to you.

Yes.

And I hope you find
your equation.

Yes. Oh.

Ah. Bye.

STEPHEN: Bye.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(DOOR OPENS)

Stephen?
Oh.

Yeah.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Well, then, here we are.

A little challenge
for you all,

<i>as</i> you embark upon your
separate doctoral journeys,

whatever they may be,
Mr. Hawking.

Pass them down.

Something to separate
the men from the boys,

the wheat from the chaff,

the mesons from
the pi mesons,

the quarks from the quacks.

Ten questions,
each more impregnable
than the last.

Good luck.
You'll need it.

Shall we say Friday,
(CLEARS THROAT)

This is going
to hospitalize me.

And, one. Drive!

Two. Drive!
(GRUNTING)

Three. Drive!

Stay long, Brian.
BRIAN: I'll give you
something long.

Stay long, Brian!
Keep long, Brian!

BRIAN: Shut up!

Long, Brian!
BRIAN: I'm exhausted!

Stay long, Brian!
(YELLS)

(BELL DINGS)

BRIAN: Flip it.
Flip it, Wiggs.

(BRIAN LAUGHS)

ELLIS: Somebody else,
for once.

Can I get two more
of those, please?
BARTENDER: Yeah, sure.

And some change
for the payphone.
Yeah.

Steve, you all right, mate?

DIANA: Jane.

No, of course,
Timothy turned out
to be an absolute cad.

I mean, you'll never
guess who I saw him
with the other day.

Caroline!

(LAUGHS) For heaven's sake,
she can have him,
quite frankly.

What's the probability?

Reasonably low.
(CHUCKLES)

Um... This is...
This is Stephen.

Do you play croquet?
JANE: Croquet?

Not recently.

Sunday morning.

JANE: Actually busy
Sunday mornings.

Oh.

Him.

Okay.

DIANA: (LAUGHING)
Anyway, before
I was completely interrupted...

Oh, come on, get up.

How many did you get?

Morning, Brian.

Good afternoon, Stephen.

How many of the impossible
questions did you do?

Brian, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

How many of Sciama's
questions did you get,
Stephen?

None.
You didn't get any?

I was going to
do them later.

You haven't even
looked at them.

No.

Stephen, are you aware
that you have
voluntarily embarked upon

a PhD in physics, at the most
prestigious college in England?

Yes.
Oh.

I thought maybe you'd
slept through the induction
or something.

<i>Bri?</i>

What?

Can you whip on
some Wagner?

Oh, sod off.

(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

(SIGHS)

(GROANS)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Come in, Stephen.
Sorry.

Um, Michael,
that's so illegible,

I can't quite decipher
how wrong it is.
I suspect enormously.

And, Brian,
that's just baffling.

Have you even
bothered, Stephen?

Oh, sorry. Uh...

SCIAMA: Right.
Train timetables.

STEPHEN: Ah.
(CHUCKLES)

That's, uh,
totally unacceptable.

These expired a month ago.

(CHUCKLES) It's on the back,
I had a little accident.

Ah.

I could only do nine.

SCIAMA: Good Lord.

Oh, thank God. Bravo.

(MOUTHING) Nine?

SCIAMA: Come in.

Ah, Stephen,
take a seat.

(DOOR CLOSES)

I wanted to talk to you
about your subject.

We're all rather concerned
as to what it's going to be.

I can't decide.

Do you have any ideas?

No.

So, this is where J.J. Thomson
discovered the electron,

and where Rutherford
split the atom.

You know, one of the
great rewards of this job
is one never knows

from where the next
great leap forward

is going to come,
or from whom.

Listen, next Friday,
I'm taking a few graduates
of merit to London

to attend a talk by the
mathematician Roger Penrose.

Do come along,
if you're interested.

Oh, and close the door
as you leave.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

So, I gather you've
never been to church.

Once upon a time.

Tempted to convert?

I have a slight problem
with the whole
"celestial dictator" premise.

Now, what are you
doing for lunch?

Ma makes a cracking roast.

Ah, so, Jane,
what are you studying?
(CLEARS THROAT)

Arts.
Spuds?

Thank you.

Um, French and Spanish.

I'm hoping to do
a PhD eventually.

Oh, what on?

Medieval poetry of
the lberian Peninsula.

FRANK: Medieval poets?

What painters do you like?

Well, I like Turner.

(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Turner, really?

You know, I always feel
that his paintings

look <i>as</i> if they've been
left out in the rain.

Oh.
STEPHEN: Pa.

(PHILIPPA LAUGHS)
And William Blake.

FRANK: Thank you, Mother.
Oh, good heavens,
surely not.

FRANK: Jane, have some of my
elderflower wine. (CORK POPS)

Oh, yes, thank you.
STEPHEN: Don't touch it.

Don't touch it, Jane.
Thank you. Mother?

Stephen doesn't like
my home-made wine.

Philistine.

I'm going to send you back with
a couple of bottles. (CHUCKLES)

So, Stephen, you have come
from church with a good woman.

Are you feeling holier
than thou?

Positively saintly.
Thank you.

(CHUCKLES)
You haven't said why
you don't believe in God.

A physicist can't allow his
calculations to be muddled

by a belief in
a supernatural creator.

Sounds <i>less</i> of an
argument against God
than against physicists.

(PHILIPPA LAUGHS)
Light or dark?

Jane, light meat or dark?
Oh, light, please.

I'm inviting Jane to be my
partner to the May Ball.

FRANK: Really? Ah.

PHILIPPA:
Very impressive.

(MOUTHING)
ISOBEL: You'll have
to dance this year, Stephen.

(PHILIPPA CHUCKLES)

FRANK: Make way for Mother's leg.
Here we go.

Hello.

Hello.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Ooh. Sorry.
(CHUCKLES)

You okay?
Yeah.

Do you dance, Stephen?
No.

(BOTH LAUGH)

No. I don't dance.

It's a phenomenon
I'm very happy to observe,

but I can't possibly
imagine participating.

I absolutely agree.

I mean, who would
want to dance?
(CHUCKLES)

No, I'm serious.
I don't dance.

No dancing, then.

You see how the men's
shirtfronts and their bow ties,

how they glow more
than the women's dresses?

JANE: Yes.

Do you know why?
(CHUCKLES) Why?

Tide.

The washing powder?

The fluorescence in
the washing powder
is caught by the UV light.

Why do you know that?
(CHUCKLES)

When stars are born,
and when they die,

they emit UV radiation.

So if we could see the night
sky in the ultraviolet light,

then almost all the <i>stars</i>
would disappear

and all that we would see

are these spectacular
births and deaths.

I reckon it would
look a little...

Like that.

(ALL CHEERING)

(WHOOPING)

Wow!

Oh! Did you see?
(LAUGHING)

Like those.
Like those ones...

(ALL CHEERING)

(BAND PLAYING)

Why?

Why what?

Why Spanish medieval poetry?

I suppose I like
to time-travel.

Like you.

Are there any particular time
periods that you like to visit?

I imagine the Twenties
was fun.

The Roaring Twenties.
Mmm.

"Seek, then,

"No learning
from starry men,

"Who follow with

"The whirling ways

(JANE SIGHS)

"In the beginning was the
Heaven and the Earth.

"And the Earth was

"and darkness

"was upon the face

MAN: (OVER <i>PA)
The train now departing
from platform three is</i>

<i>the nine-seventeen service
to London King's Cross.</i>

(TRAIN HORN HOOTING)

Come on, Stephen.
Get a move on.

What's wrong with
you, man? Chop-chop.

(TRAIN HORN HOOTING)

A star, more than three
times the size of our sun,

ought to end its life how?

With a collapse.

The gravitational forces
of the entire mass

overcoming the electromagnetic
forces of individual atoms,

and so collapsing inwards.

If the star is
massive enough,

it will continue
this collapse,

creating a black hole,

where the warping
of space-time is so great
that nothing can escape.

Not even light.

It gets smaller.

Smaller.

The star, in fact,
gets denser,

<i>as</i> atoms,
even subatomic particles,

get literally crushed into
smaller and smaller space.

And at its end point,
what are we left with?

A space-time singularity.

Space and time
come to a stop.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

I wonder what would happen
if you applied Penrose's
theory about black holes

to the entire universe.

If Einstein is right, or if
general relativity is correct,

then the universe
is expanding, yes?

Yes.
Okay.

So, if you reverse time,
then the universe
is getting smaller.

All right.

So, what if I reverse the
process all the way back,

to see what happened at the
beginning of time itself?

At the beginning of time itself?
Yes.

So the universe,
getting smaller and smaller,

getting denser and denser,
hotter and hotter as we...

You mean wind back
the clock?

Exactly.
Wind back the clock.

Wind back the clock.
(CHUCKLES)

Is that what you're doing?
(CHUCKLING)

Are you winding back the clock?
That is what I'm doing.

STEPHEN: Well, keep winding.

And you've got quite
a long way to go.
Keep winding.

JANE: I don't want to fall in.

You've got to get back
to the beginning of time.

You've got
a long way to go.
Keep winding.

Keep winding
until you get...

A singularity?
A space-time singularity.

So, the universe born
from a black hole exploding.

Keep going.
What do you mean,
"Keep going"?

Before the universe began?

No, no, no, no. Keep going,
develop the mathematics.

(FLATLINING)

(INAUDIBLE)

(COT SQUEAKING)

DOCTOR: Okay, all right,
very good.

Push it as hard
as you can. Push it.

Push it.
As hard as you can.

STEPHEN: I am pushing
<i>as</i> hard as I can.

Why... Come on.
One, two...

Why won't it...

All right, all right.

Fourth finger,
fourth peg.

<i>DOCTOR: It's called
motor neuron disease.</i>

It's a progressive
neurological disorder

that destroys
the cells in the brain

that control essential
muscle activity,

such <i>as</i> speaking,

walking...
(INHALES DEEPLY)

...breathing, swallowing.

The signals that muscles
must receive in order
to move are disrupted.

The result is
gradual muscle decay.

Wasting away.

Eventually, the ability to control
voluntary movement is lost.

Entirely.

I'm afraid average life
expectancy is two years.

There's nothing
I can do for you.

What about the brain?

The brain isn't affected.

Your thoughts won't change,
it's just that...

Well, eventually,
no one will know
what they are.

I'm ever so sorry.

(BELL TOLLING)

MAN: Hello, Brian.

(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC TURNS OFF)

Welcome to this
week's episode of
</i>The Natural World,</i>

where this week we explore the
bizarre hibernation patterns

of the rare
Cambridge physicist

seen here in
his remarkable plumage.

So how was it?
What did they say?
How's your wrist?

I have a disease, Bri.

Is it venereal, Stephen?

(CHUCKLES)

I have motor neuron disease.

(STUTTERS)
Sorry, I don't...

It's Lou Gehrig's disease.
He was a baseball player.

Sorry, I'm lagging behind in
my pioneering research into

obscure, motor,
baseball-related diseases.
(CHUCKLES)

I have two years to live.

Sorry?

It does sound odd when you
say it out loud, doesn't it?

You... What do you mean?

No, you don't.

(STAMMERING)
What did they say?

Sorry, I don't really, um...

Will you go, Bri?

Stephen, sorry,
I was just being a berk.

(STAMMERING)
No, it's not...

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Will you go?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Stephen, phone for you.

It's a girl.

Um...

I'll... I'll... Um...

I'll see you soon.
I'll...

Yes.

She's waiting.

(DIAL TONE)

Stephen?

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

Nobody's seen him
for a while.

I suppose, you know...

Jane.Jane.

Brian, hello.
Sorry. Um...

Why don't you...
Why don't you sit down?

I'm so sorry.

I spoke to Stephen,
uh, yesterday,

and I know that
you called him...

(CONTINUES TALKING)

(TV PLAYING)

Something educational?

Very.

John is having
an affair with Martha.
But...

Martha is in love
with Alan,

and I think that Alan
is probably a homosexual
by the look of his jumper.

So...

Well, I'm just trying
to work out the mathematical
probability of happiness.

Are you close?

Some integer of zero, but no,
not quite there yet.

Stephen.

You just missed him,
he was here earlier.

JANE: Don't do this.

Go.

Croquet.

Play a game with me.

Go.

If you don't get up
and play a game with me,

I won't come back
here again.

Ever.

Come on.

(JANE SOBBING)

Leave me now.

Are you going to talk
about this or not?

Will you just go?

Is that what you want?
Yes, it is what I want.

So, please, if you care
about me at all,
then please just go.

I can't.
I have two years to live.

I need to work.
I love you.

(STUTTERING)
That's a false conclusion.

I want us to be together
for as long as we've got,

and if that's not
very long, well,
then that's just how it is.

It'll have to do.
You don't know what's coming.

It'll affect everything.

(EXHALES)

Your glasses
are always dirty.

(CHUCKLES)

There.

That's better, isn't it?

Yes.

Yes, it is.

SCIAMA: Now the solutions
to the Schrödinger equation

must vanish at the boundary
of the box, and so we have...

Time.

Oh, time,
that's your subject?

Any aspect in particular?

Time.

Come in, come in.
(CHUCKLING)

(CLEARS THROAT)

(CLEARS THROAT) I...

I don't think you realize

His life is going
to be very short.

So, be careful.

The weight of science
is against you,

and this will not be
a fight, Jane.

This is going to be
a very heavy defeat.

For all of us.

I know what you all think.
That...

That I don't look like
a terribly strong person.

But I love him,

SCIAMA: I know, I know.

THORNE: It could be
a little bit more elegant.

SCIAMA: Yes, but I...

(KNOCKING)

Come in, Stephen.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

SCIAMA: I know it's something we
were all worried about initially,

but I... I knew, Roger...

You had some reservations
about it in the early days.

Yes, but it's not uncommon
in any theory.

Yes.

Absolutely. Very well,
very well. We'll see.

SCIAMA: Welcome, Stephen.
Morning.

Would you like
to take a seat?

No, I'm fine. Thank you.

SCIAMA: You're sure?
Yeah.

So, Stephen,
in summary, um,

as we know, chapter one,
full of holes, uh,

lacks mathematical support.

Professor Thorne?
Chapter two, not really original.

Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.

Well, at least
you run with them.

Uh, chapter three, too many
unanswered questions.

SCIAMA: I agree.

And then, of course,
we have chapter four.

This black hole at
the beginning of time.

Space-time singularity.
Indeed.

It's brilliant.
Brilliant, Stephen.

Superb.

Therefore, all there is
to say is well done.

Or perhaps I should say,
to be more precise,

well done, Doctor.

PENROSE:
Bravo, Stephen.

SCIAMA: An extraordinary theory.
(CHUCKLES)

(CHUCKLES)
Thank you.

So, what next?

Prove it.

To prove with
a single equation

that time has a beginning.

Wouldn't that be nice,
Professor?

The one simple,
elegant equation

to explain everything.

Yes, it would.

It would indeed.

Thank you.

JANE: <i>To the esteemed

Doctor...
Who?

(ALL LAUGHING)

It is astonishing he's the first

bearing in mind how little
work he's been doing.

At Oxford especially,
he averaged an hour.

An hour a day,

Astonishing levels of sloth.

Well, it's convenient

(LAUGHS)

Thank you.

(INHALES SHARPLY) Sorry,
did you say something?

I said...

Yes?

There we go, Lucy.

(LUCY CRYING)
Oh, wait. Go, Jane.

(CHUCKLES)

I'll be one second.

Luce! Lucy.

(LAUGHING)

Jane?

JANE: Oh, Stephen.
Oh. Hello...

(CHUCKLES)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

I've got an idea.

(CHUCKLES)
Jane...

Jane, I've had an idea.

Hello.
Hello, Dennis.

Hello, Dennis.
How are you?

Okay. Good luck.

SCIAMA: He'll be fine.
He'll be fine.

Oops. Sorry.

No problem.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Allowing us to predict

that some particles can,
in fact, escape a black hole.

So, black holes
are not, in fact,
black at all,

but glow
with heat radiation.

The steady emission
of heat energy

causes the black holes
to lose mass

and eventually they disappear
in a spectacular explosion.

It's very, very simple, in the
way that a body loses heat.

Second law of thermodynamics.
BRIAN: Right, it's thermodynamics.

(STUTTERING)

If we can imagine
that a black hole

is, indeed,
losing particles

and over time,
will diminish in size,
it will evaporate, it will...

Disappear.

So

first

a star vanishes
into a black hole.

And then

the black hole itself

vanishes.

Gone, nothing.

From nothing to nothing!

You owe me another beer.

I have just shown you
that our friend has proven

that time, indeed,
has a beginning.

Not only that, how the
universe was born,

and...
How it will end.

Bang!

Crunch!

It's, uh, beautiful,
it's racy, it's...

Complete nonsense!

It's preposterous!

Was it something I said,
Professor?

Uh, excuse me.

(DOOR SLAMS) My name is
Professor Khalatnikov

from the Soviet
Academy of Science.

As you know,

my field is evolution
of the hot universe,

the properties of the microwave
background radiation

and the theory
of black holes.

To be honest,

I came here today

expecting to hear
a lot of nonsense.

I go home disappointed.

The little one here

has done it!

(MURMURING)

He has done it!

(ALL APPLAUDING)

It is a pleasure
to meet you, Professor.

Entirely my pleasure.

My pleasure.

STEPHEN: Thank you.

PROFESSOR: Well done, Stephen.

STEPHEN: Well,
that went pretty well,
all things considered.

SCIAMA: I was
worried for a while.

(LAUGHING)

Hey, come on, genius!
BRIAN: Oh, very funny!

(CHUCKLING)

You've had enough

Oh, uh...
Come on, codger.

One, two,

three!

(GROANING)

My God! How does Jane manage?
(GRUNTING)

Stephen,

your motor-mouth disease,
does it affect, um...

What?

Uh, everything?

What? No.

Different system.

(CHUCKLING) Automatic.
Are you serious?

Well, that's
pretty wonderful, isn't it?

Well, it certainly
explains a lot about men.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

STEPHEN: Hurry up!

(CHUCKLING) Come on!

(GROANING)

(CHUCKLING)

Please.
(BRIAN LAUGHING)

What is it?

It's a surprise.

Right.

Keep them closed.
(CHUCKLING)

JANE: Ta-da!

(CHUCKLING)
Look, Daddy, look!

JANE: That is
an electric wheelchair.

If you don't like it,
we can take it back.

<i>SCIAMA: I don't understand.
You've spent years</i>

assuming black holes exist
and you believe

Cygnus X-1 could
well turn out to be

the first black hole
that we can actually observe.

And yet, you've bet Kip Thorne
it's not a black hole.

Yes.

What did you bet him?

A one-year subscription
to a magazine.

Which magazine? Nature?
No.

<i>Penthouse.</i>

Penthouse? (CHUCKLING)
(CHUCKLING) Yes.

Gonna get you!

(STEPHEN GROANING)
(ROBERT CHUCKLING)

ROBERT: Daddy, look out!
Let's get Mummy!

STEPHEN: Come on...

ROBERT: Gonna get you.

Mummy, Mummy!

Come and look!

(CLATTERING AND CLANKING)

We're gonna get you.

FRANK: Hello!

Hello!
Hello.

There you are.
Hello, Pa!

Isn't it marvelous?
(GRUNTING)

What about
these steps, Frank?
FRANK: Lucy!

Steps are nothing, Jane.

Stephen! Here we are!
STEPHEN: Hello!

Yes, here we go.

Once we're up at the top,
it's very snug.
Hello, Stephen.

Hello.
There we go.

Turn you around, Stephen.
Want me to pull?

No, no, I'll be fine.
You get the luggage.

Here we go.
Off we go. Let's go.
I'll lift it up.

(FRANK GRUNTING)

(GRUNTING) There we are,
you see? Quite easy.

And up one,
there we go.

ISOBEL: Shimmering?

FRANK: Um, uh, the...

Oh, rain coming down,
shivering cold? Cold?

Uh, no.
Um, the, uh, falling.

Falling... Um...
Ooh!

Very cold.
What is it?

(CHOKING)

I'm having a jolly...

Okay, take Lucy.
One minute.

Oh.

What is it?

(STEPHEN CHOKING)

(GRUNTING)
Ah...

Is it out?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Some water.
No, don't worry.

(SIGHING)

Okay, that's it.

There we go.
(STEPHEN SNORTING)

It's okay.
It's okay.

He needs to see
a specialist.

Keeps happening
over and over again.

Ridiculous.
STEPHEN: No doctors.

No doctors.

FRANK: All right,
no doctors.

(SNORTING AND GASPING)

FRANK: A little water.

(SNIFFLING)

(SNIFFLING)

Stephen.

I need help.

If only for Robert.

He's missing out
on his childhood.

I keep looking for a way
to make this work,

but I can't find it
on my own.

STEPHEN: Everything is fine.

We're just a normal family.

We're not a normal family.

We're not a normal family!

Robert.

Your mother is
very angry with me.

(SIGHING)

Thanks.

(SIGHING)

Jane.

Jane, stop.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Sit.

(LIQUID POURING)

Now,

(LIQUID POURING)

I'd like to make
a suggestion.

Might sound a bit unusual,
but I have seen it
work wonders.

I think

that you should consider
joining the church choir.

(CHUCKLING)

Mum,

I think that's possibly
the most English thing
anyone has ever said.

Maybe so.

I used to love singing.

You're very good at it.

I don't know about that.

Just go.

It's one hour a week.

Mmm-hmm.
Mmm.

(SINGING IN LATIN)

Really lovely, everyone.

Okay. See you next week.

Bye-bye.
Bye.

Goodbye.

Hello.
Hello.

Have you come to sing?

Um...

I just came to, um...

(CHUCKLING) Soprano?

Mezzo.
Ah!

Lovely, just what we need.

Where have you been hiding?

Good question.

Well, you're here now,
and, uh, just in time,

as they say.

Oh, uh, you know, I have to
come back anyway, <i>so...</i>
Good.

You have everything?
Yes, thank you. Yes.

Thank you for coming.

You will be
a valuable asset.

Thank you. (CHUCKLING)
(CHUCKLING)

Um...

Well, I should be going.

Um, and if your son wants
those piano lessons, just...

Yes, yes, absolutely.
I, <i>um...</i> Call me.

I will do.
Great.

My husband
adores music, too.

Oh, well, I could...
Does he play?

Um...

I could teach him,
as well. Um...

That's a long story.

But, um...
Ah, okay.

Well, thank you, Jonathan.
My pleasure, Jane.
See you again.

Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

(PIANO PLAYING)

Third finger. No, that...
That one, there.

Try lifting your wrists a little bit.
Keep your elbows back.

Okay, try again.

ROBERT: No.

(CHUCKLING) Good.
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

JANE: More wine?

Um, why not?
Thank you.

Stephen?
No.

(JONATHAN CLEARING THROAT)

Stephen, Jane was telling me
that you have
a beautiful, uh, theorem.

Um...

That proves that
the universe, um,

had a beginning.
Is that it?

That was my PhD thesis.

My new project
disproves it.

Uh, disproves it? Oh.
Yes.

Um, so then you no longer
believe in the creation?

What one believes
is irrelevant in physics.

"Irrelevant in physics."

Oh. (CLEARING THROAT)

I see.

Stephen's done a U-turn.

The big new idea is that the
universe has no boundaries at all.

No boundaries,
no beginning.

And no God. Oh.

Oh, I see. I... (CHUCKLES)
I thought that, um,

you'd proved the universe
had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator.

(CHUCKLES) My mistake.

No, mine.

Stephen is looking
for a single theory

that explains all the
forces in the universe.

Therefore, God must die.

Oh, uh, why must God die?
I don't see.

The two great pillars
of physics

are quantum theory,

the laws that govern
the very small particles,
electrons and so on,

and general relativity.

Ah, yes, Einstein.

Einstein's theory,
the laws that govern

the very large planets
and such.

But quantum and relativity...

Don't tell me.
They're different?

They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

If the world were all
potatoes, then, easy.

You could trace
a precise beginning

as Stephen once did.

A moment of creation.

Hallelujah. God lives.

If you incorporate peas
into the menu,

well, then it all
goes a little...

Tits up.
Oh. (CHUCKLING)

Yes. Haywire.

It just all becomes
a godless mess.
Oh, dear.

(CHUCKLING)
Einstein hated peas.

Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."

STEPHEN: Seems
he not only plays dice,

but he throws them
where we can't find them.

God is back on
the endangered species list.
(JONATHAN CHUCKLING)

Well, I expect he'll cope.

And physics
is back in business.

JANE: Yes.

<i>Physics is</i> back <i>in business.</i>

I was, uh, married,
actually.

Um... But, sadly,
she passed.

Almost a year ago now.

(EXHALING)

it was, uh, leukemia.

Um, she fought it
and I nursed her.

But, uh, in the end...

Um...
(SIGHING)

I do get quite lonely.

The, uh, (INHALING DEEPLY)
tyranny of the empty room

and all that.

But music is my salvation.
Teaching and playing.

Not really as a career,
but I'm not very ambitious.

Though that's not...

(SIGHING)

Is that a sin?
I don't know.

Wrong man to ask.

Thank you so much
for having me.

Thank you for coming.
It was really, really wonderful.

If there's anything
I can do to be of service,

um, to you,

to the family,
I mean, I would

consider it a privilege.

I have no children
or commitments, so...

I only mean that
if I could be of help,

I believe I might
find a purpose that would

help alleviate my own,
um, situation. (CHUCKLES)

Good night.

Night.

I understand

if you need help.

If someone is prepared
to offer it,

I won't object.

(LAUGHING)

Chilly? (CHUCKLING)

(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, it's very bracing.

(CHUCKLES)
Come on. Ready?

Yeah.
(GRUNTING) All right.


There we go. Right. I'm
going to put the kettle on.

(PIANO PLAYING)

<i>(SINGING) Calls you one

<i>To gain his everlasting hall</i>

<i>Christ was born to save</i>

JONATHAN: Great, lovely, okay.
We can go.

Just gone 7:45.

(CHUCKLES) Um, could you all
leave your copies?
Goodbye.

There's something
I need to tell you.

What?

I'm pregnant.

(CHUCKLES)

Gosh, I, um, assumed
that you and Stephen, um...

Well, that's really wonderful.

It is.
Yes, wonderful.

(CHUCKLES)
Congratulations, Jane.

Thank you.

Everyone say, "Cheese."
Ready?

On the count of three.
One, two, three.

ALL: Cheese!

Cheese.

JANE: (GASPING) Is that your brother?
On his bike?

LUCY: Mummy!
Just coming.

Oh, come on, sweetie.
Come on...

Now, you know
(CLEARING THROAT)

I've always been supportive
of your choice not
to have home help,

but we need to find
a permanent solution.

This, uh, situation
cannot continue.

You need to have a proper
live-in nurse immediately.

We have help.

Look, you know
what I'm talking about.

We can't afford
a live-in nurse.

Stephen, you need
to find a way

for your family's sake.

You're world-famous.

For black holes,
not for rock concerts.

Stephen, this isn't funny.

I believe it's urgent.

(WATER RUSHING)

We do have
a right to know.

We have a right
to know, Jane.

Know what?

ISOBEL: Whose child
Timothy is.

Stephen's or Jonathan's.

That's what
you think of me.

There's no way that Timothy
could have any other father
than Stephen.

None.

(DOOR CLOSING)

Jonathan.

Please don't go.
I have to go.

Come on.
Everyone is talking...

So, what does it matter?

It's difficult for me because
I'm just trying to help.

I know you're trying to help,
and your help is valued.

The best thing for me
right now is...
I think maybe if (STAMMERING)

I just step back for now.

Please, Jonathan.
We need you.

The children need you,
and I need you,
and Stephen needs you.

Jonathan.
There's other things as well.

Jane, I...

(SIGHING)

I have feelings for you.

And I have feelings
for you, too.

Thank you, Jane.

I've been invited
to the Bordeaux Opera.

Invited where?

Bordeaux.

To Bordeaux?
Mmm.

Wagner.

The students can take me.

I know you hate flying.

(CHUCKLING)

I do hate to fly.

Bring the car.

Meet me in Bordeaux.

Take the children camping.

It'll be too difficult
to manage, Stephen.

Bring Jonathan.

I doubt he would
be willing.

(DOOR OPENING)

Hello, Stephen.

Is this okay?

Well...

I won't tell if you won't.

Just bearing in mind
you have to drive.

(LAUGHING)

Jane needs help.

Sarah, you won't forget a
vitamin B injection...
Yes?

...as soon as you land.
No. Of course.

And you'll call me
when you get to the hotel?
I will.

Yes? Promise? Good.
Yes.

Stephen.

Mum will take the baby.

(KISSING) She'll be here any minute.
See you in Bordeaux.

And be good.

Are they asleep?

(WHISPERING) Yeah.

(CHUCKLING)

Okay. It's okay.
I'm all right.
Where are the children?

I think we've done
rather well.
Mmm.

Right. Children?

Get your sleeping bags.

Thank you.

(GIGGLING)

Thank you. Thanks.

(FASTENING ZIPPER)

Jonathan?

(GRUNTING)

(CHOKING)

PERSON: Shh!

(COUGHING)

Oh, God!

Excuse me, sorry.

Jonathan?

Jonathan.

Stephen's been taken ill.

He's in hospital and

he, uh... He's in a coma.
Stephen's been taken ill?

(EQUIPMENT BEEPING)

(JANE SPEAKING FRENCH)

What are you talking about?

This way would be
a painless end.

If we try to bring him round
from the anesthetic,

it's not sure
he will survive resuscitation.

You have to bring him round
from the anesthetic.

Are you sure
it's what you want?

The only way of weaning him
off the ventilator

will be to give him
a tracheotomy.

A hole in the neck,
bypassing the throat.

He will never speak again.

There's no question.

Stephen must live.

I will see he gets
everything he needs.

I will have him transferred
back to Cambridge.

He may not survive
the journey.

Yes, he will.

I know.

l'll

Step back.

Did you get everything
in the car?

His chair and his equipment
and everything?

(MOUTHS)

(ENGINE STARTING)

Goodbye.

(CHATTERING)

Stephen?

This is a spelling board.

Firstly, you tell me
what letter you want

by blinking when I say
the color of the group

that contains the letter.

Once I know the group,
you can choose

the character
inside that group

by blinking again
when I say

the color of each letter
within that group.

Apparently.

Let's just try.

She comes
highly recommended.

Promise not to eat

Okay?

Here we are.

Elaine, Stephen.

Stephen, Elaine.

Lovely to meet you,

Now, you should have
everything you need.

But if there's anything else,
I'll be just next door.

Great.

I think
we'll get straight to work.

Thank you, Jane.

Oh, if you could

Of course.

(LAUGHS)

So, how did you get on?

You know...

I think he's
the most brilliant man
I've ever met.

You're very lucky.

Thank you.

You must worship
the ground beneath...

His wheels?

And he's
the perfect patient.

He's so funny!

When you read about him...

Let's see how you get on,
shall we, Elaine?

TECHNICIAN: That's
tightened up.

As you can see,
it's height-adjustable

and we can change the angle
to whatever Steve wants it at.

You know, it's cutting-edge.

JANE: So,
how does it work?

It uses
a very simple interface

that scans
through the alphabet,

selects each letter
one at a time.

I mean,
using this technique,
the Professor can expect

to write about
four words per minute.

Good. Better than
one a minute.

(LAUGHS) Yes,
and what I've done

is taken the components
from a telephone
answering system, actually,

to convert
the written text

into synthesized speech.

I mean, the voice sounds
a little bit robotic,

but, um,
shall we give it a try?

Great.
Here's the clicker.

JANE: Right hand?

TECHNICIAN: There you go.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Of course it is.

That's what they all say.

You don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me,
Professor.

I know what men are like.

Shall we take a look?

There you go.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(DOOR OPENS)

Oh! I'm sorry.

Next one?

What?

<i>STEPHEN: So I said, "I have
long been looking for
a model of the universe.</i>

<i>"I finally found her."
(LAUGHING)</i>

I bet you did.

(LAUGHING)

Stephen, I need to steal you.
The contract's arrived.

Could you just give us
a minute, please, Jane?

There we go.

Like new.

(ELAINE CHUCKLES)

"Who are we?

"Why are we here?

"If we ever learn this,

"it will be the ultimate
triumph of human reason,

"for then we would know
the mind of God."

Do you mean this?

Yes.

<i>Of course.</i>

So, you're acknowledging him?

However...

"However" what?

Are you actually going to
let me have this moment?

<i>You are welcome.</i>

<i>I have asked Elaine to travel
with me to America.</i>

<i>She will look after me.</i>

Will she?

Yes.

You always used to tell me
when an invitation came in.

<i>Another award.
What can you do?</i>

<i>I am sorry.</i>

<i>How many years?</i>

They said two.

You've had so many.

(SOBS)

<i>Everything will be okay.</i>

I have loved you.

(WHISPERS) I did my best.

(SOBS)

Careful.

That... That's staying.

All right.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Bye, Jonathan.

WOMAN: Professor,
I love your book!

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>I first met the Professor</i>

<i>in 1963.</i>

<i>Now there you are. Time!</i>

<i>Where does it go?</i>

<i>It has been
one of the great joys</i>

<i>of my life to watch this man
defy every expectation,</i>

<i>both scientific and personal.</i>

<i>Please welcome onto the stage
my esteemed colleague,</i>

<i>my dear friend,
Professor Hawking.</i>

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

<i>Thank you.
Could we please have</i>

<i>the first pre-selected
question? Thank you.</i>

<i>Can you hear me?</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now you are
recognized everywhere.

How do you deal
with all the attention?

<i>I was stopped recently
by a tourist in Cambridge,</i>

<i>who asked if I was
the real Stephen Hawking.</i>

<i>I replied I was not
and said the real one
was much better looking.</i>

In 1979, you talked
about the possibility

of a theory of everything
being discovered
before the end of the century.

<i>I now predict
that I was wrong.</i>

Professor Hawking,

you have said you do not
believe in God.

Do you have a philosophy of life
that helps you? (FADES OFF)

You have said
you do not believe in God.

Do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you?

<i>It is clear that we are
just an advanced breed
of primates</i>

<i>on a minor planet orbiting
around a very average star</i>

<i>in the outer suburb of one
among 100 billion galaxies.</i>

<i>But,</i>

<i>ever since
the dawn of civilization,</i>

<i>people have craved
for an understanding</i>

<i>of the underlying order
of the world.</i>

<i>There ought to be
something very special</i>

<i>about the boundary conditions
of the universe.</i>

<i>And what can be more special
than that
there is no boundary...</i>

<i>And there should be no
boundary to human endeavor.</i>

<i>We are all different.</i>

<i>However bad life may seem,</i>

<i>there is always something
you can do and succeed at.</i>

<i>While there is life,
there is hope.</i>

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

That came.

It's from Stephen.

Gosh.

Your glasses are always dirty.

EQUERRY: Professor and Mrs.
Hawking, Her Majesty the Queen.

Congratulations...

My Companion of Honour.

Not bad
for an old liberal socialist.

(WHISPERS) Don't worry, you
can decline the knighthood.

Thank you, for today.

It was extraordinary.

It's all been rather
extraordinary though, hasn't it?
